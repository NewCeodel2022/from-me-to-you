WEBVTT

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.769
I met him the morning
of the entrance ceremony

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.855
under cherry blossoms.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.629
Do you go to Kitahoro High?

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.007
Are you a freshman?

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.344
Yes.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.222
Me too.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.684
The cherry trees are in full bloom.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:02.812
Indeed.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.358
Oh! The opening ceremony will start soon!

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.944
Oh.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.072
Excuse me!

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:13.531
Yeah?

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.036
The school is this way.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.332
Oh!

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.000
Thanks.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:32.342
My heart…

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.011
it's awakened.

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:37.764
I want it to reach…

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.475
from me…

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:42.894
to you.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:56.407
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.128
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.633
I got a new phone yesterday.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.801
Seriously?

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.052
-Let me see! Let me see!
-Yeah.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.763
The camera is amazing.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.099
-Look.
-Did you take that yourself?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.351
-Yeah. Isn't is awesome?
-It's amazing!

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.562
-I can change the brightness.
-Let's take one now.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.355
-Sure. Say cheese!
-Cheese!

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:29.149
Excuse me.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.650
You…

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.655
dropped this.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.324
Uh, thank you.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.326
Uh, I don't need it.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.745
Ooh! That was scary.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.545
I'm Sawako Kuronuma.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.008
But Sadako has been my nickname
since the fourth grade.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.804
Yes, the Sadako from the horror movie.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.351
Good morning.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.687
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.524
Oh no,
I think I looked into her eyes.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.735
How scary.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.487
Hardly anyone
knows my real name.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.865
But they're scared of me.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.333
You mean Sadako from The Ring?

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.377
Yeah.
Apparently, Sadako's her real name.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.630
They say she has a sixth sense.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.674
For sure. She has that vibe.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.845
You'll be cursed if your eyes meet
for more than three…

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.306
…seconds.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.897
I'm done. Go ahead.

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.324
MATH 1 - FRESHMAN CLASS D
SAWAKO KURONUMA

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.372
Man, I could go for some ramen.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.623
What? It's still morning.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:11.000
-Well, then how about after school?
-Sounds good.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.418
-Ryu, good morning!
-Morning.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.879
We're coming over today for some ramen.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.465
How can you think of ramen in the morning?

00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:19.467
-What's wrong with that? It's delicious.
-Yeah.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.219
For sure. What kind will you have?

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:24.013
Rather than Kuronuma or Sadako,

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:28.268
I wish I were more pleasant,
like how my name sounds.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.853
-Morning.
-Morning, Kazehaya.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.397
Morning.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.857
Just like Kazehaya…

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.113
Morning, Kuronuma.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.282
Morning.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.743
-Morning.
-Morning, Kazehaya.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.372
Kazehaya is kind to everyone,
no matter who it is.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.624
-It was this big.
-Yeah, it was that big!

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.210
He's always
the center of attention,

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.212
and he's always so cheerful and pleasant.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.965
Everyone is drawn to him.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.553
He treats me like he does others.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.723
Kazehaya is my inspiration.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.560
We were thinking
of just doing it ourselves,

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.228
but here it is.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:16.858
So, the test of courage will take place
the day before the last day of term.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.152
And if you plan on coming,
then write your name here.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.613
We're hoping for everyone to join.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.283
Please write your name.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.912
-Are there any prizes? Penalties?
-That's a great idea! I'll think about it.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.205
Whoa!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.292
Then shouldn't there be
someone to play a ghost?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.545
It's better not to add
anything fake to it.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.465
I guess that could ruin it.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.428
All right. Take a seat, everyone.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.221
Homeroom will begin.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.681
Settle down.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.935
For today's announcements,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.356
I need one person to help me at school
before summer classes begin.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.984
It's not for the whole summer,
so can I get a volunteer?

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.238
Uh, what? No way.

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.908
If no one volunteers,
then I'll choose someone.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.786
What?!

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.039
Excuse me.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.999
What is it, Kuronuma?

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.252
Um, I can do it.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.173
I don't have anything else
to do during the break.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.759
I see. Okay, thank you.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:25.718
Wait…

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:30.181
But she's always doing stuff like that,
committee stuff and odd jobs.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:35.103
No way.
Kazehaya noticed those things?

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:40.149
Mmm, you're right about that.
Then how about you?

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.904
I guess I have no choice.
I'll do it.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:47.115
Seriously?

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:51.119
It's okay.
I have nothing else to do in the summer.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.081
And I wanted to check on
the flowers in the flower bed too.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.544
That's fine if she really wants to do it.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.838
Hmm. All right. Kuronuma it is.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:06.467
Okay. Here are some handouts
for how you should spend the break.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:19.647
This might be
the first time I've felt this motivated.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.649
Oh, Sadako!

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.694
Ah, long time no see!

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:27.029
You're in charge of the plants, huh?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.533
You haven't changed even though
you're in high school now.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.369
Did you make any friends in your class?

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.997
Uh, well, not really.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.166
That worries me.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.251
Are you okay?
You're not being bullied, are you?

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.753
Mmm, I'm fine.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.757
There's a guy named Kazehaya,
and he looks out for me.

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.177
Oh, the really pleasant guy?

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.387
So I guess he is famous.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.475
Kazehaya, he's beyond just pleasant.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.269
His pleasantness is at 120 percent.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.564
Mm-mm, even that isn't enough.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:05.193
It's shocking.
He's like a walking pleasantness.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.195
It's like he defines what pleasant means.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.613
Sadako! Sadako!

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:18.831
You should apologize,
or else he might misunderstand.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.959
Apologize?
For complimenting him?

00:08:22.543 --> 00:08:24.045
What you just said…

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.466
I'm not sure how I should take it.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.135
How?

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.143
It's a compliment!

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.148
Got it!

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.487
Kazehaya, hurry up!

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.488
I'm coming.

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:52.949
I'll be back, so wait for me.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.034
We've never really had a chance to talk.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.370
Huh?

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:03.501
I'm relieved
there was no misunderstanding.

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:05.628
Mmm.

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.381
I'll get going. Bye.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.843
I'm always being misunderstood.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.306
But Kazehaya understood how I feel.

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:22.061
He believed my words.

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:28.192
I'm so relieved.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:29.610
Huh?

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:34.365
Actually, I, uh…
I thought that you hated me.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:35.992
What?

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.995
Hate you? I would never.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:44.292
I'm always thinking about how
I want to be pleasant like you.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:48.296
I think…
I think you've got me wrong.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.381
I'm not that pleasant
of a person.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.593
Mm-mm, that's not true.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.053
Even your name is pleasant.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.307
Your name sounds more pleasant.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.643
It just means black swamp.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.521
I meant "Sawako."

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.068
Your name is Sawako Kuronuma, right?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.241
You… You know my name?

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.036
Of course I do, Sawako.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.504
Oh, uh, Kuronuma,
make sure you come to the test of courage.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.174
Mmm.

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:40.640
Kazehaya!

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.558
-Good morning!
-Oh!

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.810
-Morning.
-Morning!

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.020
Woah!

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:48.397
Hey! I thought you'd be late.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.441
-Oh no, I forgot my bento!
-No way!

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.610
-What should I do?
-How'd you forget?

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.612
-I only have bread.
-A sandwich?

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:55.696
Morning.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.947
Morning, Kuronuma.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.658
-Aah!
-Whoa!

00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.825
Come on, you two.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.662
Good morning.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.040
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.590
That was my first time talking to Sadako.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.300
What's wrong with that?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.052
But don't you get cursed?

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:20.429
What? Of course not.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.473
Anyway, about the test of courage…

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:46.122
Hey, wouldn't it be scary
if Sadako played the ghost?

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.208
That would be freaky.
But we can't make her to do it.

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.128
I feel like she'd get
the real Sadako to appear.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.548
-Stop that! That's scary!
-You think she'd do it?

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.007
Of course not.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.468
-I guess she wouldn't want to.
-Mmm.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.179
-Excuse me.
-Sadako!

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:04.473
When did you show up?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:09.145
Could you let me play the ghost
during the test of courage?

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.855
-What?
-Huh?

00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:13.190
No, thanks,
if you're doing it begrudgingly.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.443
It would look like we forced you.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.652
It's not like that.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.530
What do you mean?

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.534
I've never done things begrudgingly.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.456
Just being able to do something
for everyone would make me happy.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:34.628
Also…

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.465
I studied this during middle school.

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:38.841
82 CREEPY BUT TRUE HORROR STORIES

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:43.721
I re-read it to be able
to tell scary stories too.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:47.933
Wait, are you serious about this?

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.648
I bought a white dress recently,
but I haven't had a chance to wear it yet.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.026
I could wear it for this.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.153
To play the ghost?

00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:04.158
Oh, but there is one problem.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.952
Actually…

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.916
I don't have a sixth sense!

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.376
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.715
So I may not meet everyone's expectations.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.271
You're telling us that now?

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.440
How long has it been
since the school started?

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.359
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:40.653
Does that disqualify me
from playing a ghost?

00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:44.406
No one is expecting you
to have a sixth sense.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.368
Man, you're off. You're way off.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.369
You think so?

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.584
Why are you crying?

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.295
Sadako's courage is making me cry.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.589
You're totally off too.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:05.344
Sadako, I understand how you feel.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.138
You are the only person
who can play the ghost.

00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:10.474
We'll keep this a secret.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.269
So go out there and scare
the heck out of everyone tomorrow.

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.190
Thank you!

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.242
A curse on you.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.829
A curse on you.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:39.253
What is Sawako doing?

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.465
Her class is having
a test of courage tonight.

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:45.968
She's the ghost, huh?

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:50.014
Wait,
she's not being bullied, is she?

00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:52.433
But she looks like she's having fun.

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:55.019
A curse on you.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:01.650
You start from here,
and this is the goal.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.985
There are signs at each point,

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.696
so you have to collect them all
before reaching the goal.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.323
Also, you'll go in pairs.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:11.201
Behind the woods,
there's a 100-year-old graveyard.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.164
Be extra careful, everyone.

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:17.666
Kazehaya…

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.127
-…don't tell me you're getting scared.
-Speak for yourself.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.339
Oh, by the way, have you seen Kuronuma?

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.049
No, but she's coming?

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:28.510
-Hmm. Her name was on the list.
-Oh.

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:30.095
Actually…

00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:33.682
…she's here.

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:38.938
Are you scared?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.401
Gee, really?

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.528
Oh!

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:49.657
Did you see that?
What is that?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.408
Oh no!

00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.285
-Really?
-Oh.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.455
-I'm getting nervous now.
-It's not a big deal.

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.207
-I'm not joking.
-It'll be all right.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.259
A… A curse on you.

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.266
-Oh my!
-Did you hear that?

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.856
Sadoko's putting on a performance.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.858
That sounded really scary.

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.402
I'm starting to get scared.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.071
-Hey, Chizu, stop that!
-My stomach hurts.

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.615
A… A curse on you.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.660
Whoa!

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.215
A curse on you.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:33.886
Wait, Kuronuma?

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:36.346
Oh, Kazehaya!

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.224
Good evening.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.394
What do you mean, "Good evening"?
What are you doing?

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.980
Oh, well,

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:49.318
I talked with Yoshida and Yano
about playing a ghost,

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.905
but keeping it a secret from everyone.

00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:55.074
Jeez.

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:58.577
I was worried that you couldn't come
because something had happened.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.662
Oh, sorry.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:05.125
If I had told you,
you wouldn't be chilled to the bones.

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:08.087
You're totally taking on the role.

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.173
But isn't it scary
standing here all alone?

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:15.052
Well, I actually prefer nighttime.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.973
Especially summer evenings,
because it feels nice.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.184
The air and the smells,

00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:25.604
the rustle of leaves,
and the sounds of insects…

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.068
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:34.863
It does feel great.
Mind if I stick around a little longer?

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.281
Huh?

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.033
But, I mean…

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.830
Wait, why are you alone?

00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:47.835
Well, because someone didn't show up,

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.587
I didn't have a partner.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:51.630
Huh?

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.070
Why do people call you Sadako?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.323
Oh, well…

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:25.414
Oh, sorry. You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.000
It's not like that at all.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:31.545
In the fourth grade…

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:37.551
my friend mistakenly called me Sadako.

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:42.890
And because I resembled
the Sadako from the movie,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.476
it just stuck.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.189
You don't hate it?

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:55.235
It was a little shocking at first.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:00.199
But it's not like I was being bullied.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:06.079
Rather, it made people remember who I am.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:12.169
And by playing Sadako today,
I could be of use to others.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.716
So, I'm glad to be called Sadako.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.137
That's impressive.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.267
There's nothing impressive about me.

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.895
The one who's impressive is you.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.023
Huh? Why are you here, Kazehaya?

00:20:33.607 --> 00:20:35.108
Uh, I was taking a break.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:36.610
Oh!

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:41.782
You were worried about Sadako being here
all alone to play the ghost, weren't you?

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:43.283
What a gentleman.

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.577
-Whoo!
-Be quiet.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.704
Why didn't you tell me?

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.373
Then it wouldn't be fun.

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:56.171
Sadako, everyone was totally
complimenting you on how scary you were.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:57.881
This is for you.

00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:02.302
Oh, thanks!

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.221
Hang in there a little longer.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:05.597
See you.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.268
So where do we go from here?

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.978
Straight ahead.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:13.772
They're so kind.

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:17.276
You've finally opened up.

00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:21.822
Have I really?

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.076
Mmm. I'm glad to see that.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.830
Kuronuma…

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:33.125
you're a cheerful one, aren't you?

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.584
You are so positive.

00:21:35.502 --> 00:21:36.336
Huh?

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:41.049
You accepting being called Sadako,
and your willingness to play a ghost…

00:21:41.758 --> 00:21:45.804
That is proof that you're positive
about everything.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:53.103
No one has ever said
anything like that to me before.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:58.984
Don't look at me like that!

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.569
Oh, sorry!

00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:02.946
I got carried away.

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:07.075
I'll be careful not to stare at you
for more than three seconds.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.577
That's not what I meant.

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:11.246
You made me blush.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:13.915
Don't make me say that.

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:22.799
-Joe, are we on the right path?
-We are, I'm sure of it.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.217
Huh? Kazehaya?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.637
Sadako?

00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.598
-Wait, wait.
-But why?

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.142
She was kind enough to play a ghost.

00:22:32.225 --> 00:22:35.062
Huh? So you've been here
with her the whole time?

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:36.980
Just forget about it. Let's go.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.692
Kuronuma, hang in there.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:42.444
Mmm.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:47.783
Hey, wait! You totally scared us!

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:51.536
Hey, wait up! Wait up! Wait up!

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.960
I'm home.

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.464
-Welcome home!
-Welcome home!

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.759
How was it? Did anything bad happen?

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.347
I had a great time!
And so did everyone else.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.640
Wow.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:13.517
That's great!

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:20.065
See? You worry too much.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.701
It feels like a dream.

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.913
A… A curse on you.

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.043
Everyone enjoyed me playing the ghost.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.880
And I got a chance
to talk with Kazehaya alone.

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:52.973
But I won't be able to see him
during the summer break.

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:05.068
Summer break starts tomorrow,
so don't play around too much, okay?

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:08.864
And some of you are prepping
for your entrance exams next year.

00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:12.784
Keep in mind you can have fun
as long as it doesn't disturb others.

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:13.743
All right?

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:15.579
-Okay.
-Yes, fine.

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:18.540
Kuronuma, I'd like you
to come back tomorrow to give me a hand.

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:20.250
-Okay.
-Good.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:25.255
All right, then. I want cheerful faces
once you're back from break. Dismissed!

00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:26.173
Stand!

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:32.304
-Bow!
-Thank you!

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:42.439
Hey, Ryu!
Keep up the training during summer break.

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:43.356
Okay.

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:47.068
Before you leave,

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.946
I'll announce the results
of last night's event.

00:24:52.532 --> 00:24:54.910
We all had a great time,
so is that necessary?

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:57.329
You're just saying that
because you're in last place.

00:24:57.412 --> 00:24:59.539
There's no fooling anyone, huh?

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.541
In first place
is Hamasaki and Nakanishi.

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.877
-Yeah! All right!
-Ooh!

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.755
Your prize is assorted snacks
from Yamashita Store.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.381
Hey, I got a question!

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:10.592
Is there a penalty for Kazehaya
since he finished last?

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:14.012
Oh, I forgot to think of a penalty.

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:16.223
-Come on!
-How could you forget?

00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.767
How about dating Sadako?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.102
That's a good one!

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.605
Wasn't Kazehaya
cornered by Sadako last night?

00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:25.565
Let's say one week only?

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.192
You know…

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.529
Just become her boyfriend!

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:32.822
-Ah!
-Whoo!

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:34.366
Come on, you guys.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.618
I'll do anything besides that.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.037
Hey, that's even more mean.

00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:41.873
Calling that a penalty is beyond rude.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.334
Kuronuma is a girl.

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:46.836
It's nothing to laugh about.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.175
You don't have to be so serious about it.

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.218
Mmm, yeah.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.762
Kazehaya, wait, do you like Sadako?

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.686
Kuronuma, you can ignore them, okay?

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:04.896
Huh. He sounds like he does.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.024
Kazehaya,
don't try to defend me.

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:12.028
You've got it wrong!

00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:28.878
It's true that I was
with Kazehaya last night.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.257
But it…

00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:35.468
it wasn't anything special.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:41.433
It's just because Kazehaya
treats everyone equally.

00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:44.561
But…

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.354
it's true…

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:50.692
that I'm drawn to how kind,

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:55.113
pleasant, cheerful, and honest he is.

00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:58.742
That part is true.

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.340
P… Please excuse me.

00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:26.311
I don't think I said anything wrong.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.857
It should have resolved
their misunderstanding.

00:27:32.275 --> 00:27:33.652
All I said is true.

00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.324
I'm sure I was able
to protect his reputation.

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:51.086
Sawako, didn't you say
your break starts today?

00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:52.587
Mmm,

00:27:53.296 --> 00:27:54.798
but I'm helping my teacher.

00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.050
Hmm. Good for you.

00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:57.967
Bye.

00:27:59.052 --> 00:27:59.969
Bye.

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.402
But I'm sad.

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:23.034
Because of what I said,

00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:24.202
after the break,

00:28:25.286 --> 00:28:26.496
he may avoid me.

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:31.710
He might not even look at me…

00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:36.756
or say good morning to me with a smile.

00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:44.305
I thought I was fine to be alone,

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:48.560
but I can't remember what it was like

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:51.938
before I met him.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.790
Kazehaya. Why?

00:29:15.962 --> 00:29:18.298
This is from everyone.

00:29:25.305 --> 00:29:27.974
SORRY, SADAKO. WE WERE WRONG.
FORGIVE US. YOUR CLASSMATES

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.562
Everyone was sorry.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.356
Saying you're a hidden MVP.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:42.363
Thank you for defending me,

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.657
bringing this to me,

00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.411
and talking to me.

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.163
Thank you.

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:54.667
What do you mean, talking to you?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.341
No, it's nothing.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.095
Sorry, but I'm glad.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:07.347
I'm so happy.

00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:13.728
You know…

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:20.151
I don't… I don't think you really know me.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.529
No worries.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:24.531
I know how you feel very well.

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:25.740
No, you don't.

00:30:28.034 --> 00:30:29.035
Not at all.

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:35.208
I can get my hopes up, right?

00:30:36.584 --> 00:30:38.211
That I get to see you more?

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.559
I get to see you in summer classes
during the break?

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:55.979
Thank you.

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:59.148
I wanted to be like you, Kazehaya.

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:02.569
I really respect you.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:07.490
I have so much respect for you.

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.535
Uh…

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.413
Oh.

00:31:13.955 --> 00:31:16.291
"Respect."

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:18.960
Right.

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:20.378
What?

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:30.346
Will it reach you someday?

00:31:34.183 --> 00:31:35.435
Excuse me!

00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:41.065
The school is this way.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:49.282
The feeling I had back then…

00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:54.746
The feeling that kept growing…

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:06.007
Someday I hope it reaches from me to you.
