WEBVTT

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.509
KITAHORO HIGH SCHOOL

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.267
Although all sorts
of things happened,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.602
the second semester was near its end.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.446
Good morning, Sawako!

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.989
Oh, Chizu!

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.490
Morning!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.994
I've never been greeted
in such a friendly manner before.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.038
I'll do it every day from now on.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.330
Really?

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.457
Of course!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.750
Morning!

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.709
Morning!

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.678
Oh, did you notice my bedhead?

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.388
Oh, you're right!

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.390
I guess you didn't notice.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.976
I should've just said
this is my style. Ugh!

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.311
Good morning!

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.812
-Morning!
-Morning.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.569
-Kazehaya, about yesterday…
-What's up?

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.321
-You do your homework?
-Yeah, I did.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.239
Forget about homework! Listen up…

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.493
With the passing time,

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.829
I feel my heart moving forward
step by step.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:31.174
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.968
Actually, there is someone I like.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.012
-Whoa!
-Seriously? Who is it?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.889
-It's a secret.
-Oh!

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.308
-Come on, you have to tell us!
-Morning, Noguchi!

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.268
-Oh, good morning!
-Morning.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.020
Try and guess.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.315
Who do you think?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.777
Sawako,
are you free after school?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.780
Can you help me pick out
a birthday present for Ryu?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.740
Mmm, of course!

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.575
Thank you!

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.078
Oh no! I'm gonna lose!

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.623
Man, I totally got rocked.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.292
Ugh, this is frustrating.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.379
Come on!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.926
Hey, Ryu, help me level up.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.306
What is it?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.143
I just remembered
you talking in your sleep

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.520
and yelling out the name
of a boss from a game.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.480
What? I never talk in my sleep.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:31.442
-Well, you did.
-No, I didn't! Stop laughing.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.861
"Lion!"

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.863
What's your problem? Just do it.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.325
Oh wow!

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.494
Chizu is the only one for me.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.123
Keep it a secret, okay?

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.670
-I feel Chizu likes him too.
-This is where it gets hard.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.088
You're good!

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.381
Huh? Is that Yano?

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.555
We broke up.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.015
Were you dumped?

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.057
I dumped him!

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.018
It was such a mess.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.061
It looks that way.

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:11.274
I told him I wanted to end it,
and he cried at first.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.611
But he slapped me in the end.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.821
Ugh, that's horrible!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:20.325
It's not like this is how I planned
for things to turn out.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.785
Are you okay?

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.248
I'm giving up on love for a while.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.922
It's time! Get to your seats.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.433
You need to find a proper man.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.894
I'm not asking for advice.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.648
There aren't that many good guys
in this world.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.358
Like me.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.361
I seriously want to punch him.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.405
Okay, let's begin.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.658
You're always wearing
something like that.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.952
-Really?
-Try something else.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.036
No way.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.830
I think this would suit you.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.540
-Really?
-Yes.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.751
How about this one?

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.795
Should I look for something more feminine?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.589
-It looks great!
-Mmm, it's cute.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.049
Thank you!

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.592
He's not taking notice of me,

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.679
so maybe I'll go for
something a little more mature.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.389
For the guy you like?

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.682
You know it!

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.227
I'll wear a miniskirt
to show off my legs.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.980
It's expensive!

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.190
I won't have enough to get Ryu's present.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.026
What do you have?
Let me coordinate your outfits.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.528
-Oh, really?
-Mmm.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.530
Then stay over Friday night.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.365
You can vent all you want.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.159
-You too, Sawako!
-Huh? Is it really okay?

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.620
-I'll be there.
-Great!

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.956
-Yay!
-This weekend's gonna be so fun.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.500
WIND SPORTS

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.045
Welcome!

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.089
-Oh!
-Kazehaya?

00:04:58.756 --> 00:04:59.799
What brings you?

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:01.926
This is his family's business.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.094
What?

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:04.304
Welcome.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.099
-Excuse the intrusion.
-It's not like he lives here.

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.392
Actually, I do.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:16.816
Oh, I came to buy Ryu's birthday present.
Don't tell him.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:18.484
Okay, I won't.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.112
Do you know what Ryu wants?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.490
He mentioned wanting a new baseball glove.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:25.700
I can't afford that!

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.411
Okay, take your time.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.833
How unexpected.

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.712
Wait, are you nervous?

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.838
Mmm.

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.133
Yes, I'm totally nervous.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.843
What should I get him?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.095
What did you get him last year?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.805
Shoulder massage coupon.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:50.433
Seriously?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:54.020
Mmm, I'm broke.
Everything here is expensive.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.233
Hey, what about this?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.860
BASEBALL IDIOT

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.695
"Baseball idiot!"

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.116
I can't afford a glove,
but a bag would do.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.576
I'll splurge this year.

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:12.121
Chizu, you really care for Sanada, huh?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.956
Mmm…

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.958
He's like a brother to me.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.378
I wouldn't mind
if he really was my brother.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.755
Oh, I'm starting to blush.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.548
Then why don't you go for it?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.467
I've got no problem with that.

00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:27.720
Ch… Chizu…

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:28.679
Hmm?

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:33.601
Could that guy that you wanted
to show the miniskirt to

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.521
possibly be Sanada?

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:37.688
Huh?

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.982
Oh, I'm… I'm sorry!

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.025
It's okay.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.694
It's okay if you can't tell me.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.571
I never told you?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:49.450
Oh, sorry, I thought you already knew.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.994
Oh, so it is?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.789
I like Ryu's brother.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.084
He's working in Sapporo now,
so I don't get to see him.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.502
Huh?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.213
You're making me blush!

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:05.633
Huh?

00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:07.593
Were you listening, Kazehaya?

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.845
You need to stop that!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.765
Oh, shut it.
I could hear you even if I didn't want to.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.309
Does Sanada know?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.519
Ryu?

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:17.979
Of course he knows.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:22.150
Although, I've never actually
said it to him before.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:24.777
Okay!

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.320
-Ready to pay?
-I see.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.573
-I'll take this.
-Sure.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.201
It's 2,000 yen.

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:37.123
Chizu, thank you for inviting me today.

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:40.835
I guess it ended up being
a surprise for you.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.966
Also, thank you
for telling me who you like.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.845
The last time I saw him
was around New Year's about a year ago.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.015
I'll probably see him this year too.

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.517
And that's when I'll wear the miniskirt.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.228
You're already so psyched up.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:03.149
But he only sees me as a little sister.
He totally treats me like a child.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:07.069
But things change
once you become an adult.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.739
So I'm going to become a fine woman.

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:13.951
Oh, I'm sorry for getting all worked up.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.162
Especially considering
what you're going through, Yano.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:18.831
-You don't need to worry.
-Sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.292
-It's all right. It's okay.
-I'm the worst. I'm sorry.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.878
Come on.

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.756
Because of my feelings
for Kazehaya…

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.469
…I can now see others
having feelings like I do.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.387
-Do you think so?
-I don't.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.070
RYU'S BIRTHDAY
DECEMBER 2

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.265
I… I found it first!

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:19.559
No, I'm the one who found it.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.523
It's not right to make a girl cry, Ryu.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.323
Aw, don't cry. How about a smile?

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:53.301
One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven!

00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:58.347
-Okay.
-Whoo!

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.975
Four, five!

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.907
HOW TO TRAIN
GIVING EACH PLAY YOUR ALL

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.626
Hello?

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.420
Hey, brother. What's up?

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:33.257
Huh?

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:34.884
This weekend?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.553
-The food is ready!
-Yes.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.139
-Table six, coming right up!
-Yes.

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:42.850
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:44.810
Mmm!

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.813
-It's delicious as always.
-Coming.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:48.814
-Mmm. Oh, Pops…
-Hmm?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.650
I can help with the store
during winter break.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:51.942
Oh, that would be helpful.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.153
I am the poster girl
for this place, after all.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.575
You know,
I really wish you were my daughter.

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:02.370
I would totally be up for that.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.914
-Really?
-After I'm done eating, I'll stick around.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:08.042
Sure! Stay as long as you want,
even for a year or two.

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.503
I just might
stay around for a year.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.421
That sounds scary in a way.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.719
Hey, you're free on the second, right?

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.472
Can I play your game?

00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.393
You can get to a higher level by then.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.770
Maybe after dinner?

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:28.688
Sure.

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.984
Uh, actually, I can't.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:34.985
Huh?

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:39.573
That day is no good.
You can't come over the weekend.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.033
Huh? Why not?

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.203
Well…

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.207
It's family time, I mean.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.292
Huh?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.009
Oh, I see how it is!

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:02.138
I mean, it's not like I'm family, right?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.808
Why would you say such a thing
all of a sudden?

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.726
Whatever!

00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:23.659
She turned me down.
It was an honorable defeat.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.579
I don't know about confessing your love
to someone you've never talked to.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.497
Hey, be nice!

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.541
Okay,
let's have a pity party later.

00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:31.792
Sounds good.

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:36.964
-You should be thanking Kazehaya.
-Seriously?

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.841
Come on, seriously?

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:51.103
Ryu, did something happen?

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.274
My brother's coming home this weekend.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.276
Did you tell Yoshida?

00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:59.487
No.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.781
I only told her not to come over
the weekend.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.824
That explains her mood.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.993
I couldn't tell her.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.707
If it were you, would you tell her?

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.043
Mmm…

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:17.171
I guess.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.674
Since it wouldn't be for me to decide
what happens between them.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.596
I thought you'd say that.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.390
Huh? Then why would you even ask?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.730
How does it go with this?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.650
Oh, I think it looks great!

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.822
Hey, why are you so sulky?

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.157
You're making me look like a fool here.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.367
Chi… Chizu.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.499
Dammit! I hate this!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.383
What's with him?

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.054
I feel like we're brother and sister.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:09.139
I… I know it's not the case, but…

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:14.728
…if he shuts me out like that,
there's nothing I can say.

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.190
What a coward!

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:23.112
Hey, I thought you were supposed
to be listening to me vent.

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:30.369
Maybe Sanada had a reason for saying that.

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:32.621
What?

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:35.374
Yeah, that's right!

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.668
That's right! Let's go.

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.253
Let's go talk to him.

00:14:40.504 --> 00:14:43.340
Things got awkward for us
because we didn't do that, remember?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.093
Right, Sawako?

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.304
Mmm.

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:53.809
There's no other choice.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:55.561
Let's go!

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.277
Eight!

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.237
-That's pretty far along.
-My spin.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:10.034
Seven, eight. "Your company is bankrupt."
A ten-billion-yen loan?!

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:12.119
Hey, stop that!

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.579
I hate this!

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:17.833
-Another loan? Jeez!
-Okay, okay.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.585
Sorry for coming over.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.213
-I'm used to the noise.
-I guess you are.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.924
That worked out for us.

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.342
Ryu, I'm coming in.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.177
Nothing good
has happened to me today.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.803
Why are you all here?

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.597
We're here to comfort Joe.

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.726
-Oh, Yano is here! Come!
-What?

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:38.312
We've got another broken-hearted buddy!

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:40.189
Shall we make it
a pity party for two?

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:44.276
-Oh, good idea.
-Yano, my broken-hearted buddy!

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.029
You never know.
Love might bloom between us.

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.073
-That would never happen.
-What?

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:50.783
-Never?
-Never!

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:52.284
-Ryu.
-But why?

00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:53.911
Can we talk?

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.704
Huh?

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.248
-Jeez.
-Hey, stop crying!

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.334
-Sure.
-Since you're here, spin it.

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:01.418
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.880
-I'm sure it's my turn next.
-Five?

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.424
-Is it another loan? Is it?
-What'd you spin?

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.134
RAMEN
TETSURYUKEN

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:13.806
So why did you talk
to me like that the other day?

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:14.974
Hmm?

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.602
Did I do something to you?

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.605
Oh.

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.440
That.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:26.318
No, you didn't. Sorry.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.281
It's fine if you're really sorry about it.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:33.826
Are you busy on Sunday?

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:36.537
Then I guess it can't be helped.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.707
I'm sorry for getting angry.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.756
I didn't know if I should tell you.

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:49.925
Hmm?

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.469
I'm all ears. What's up?

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.305
Well…

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.519
Actually, tomorrow…

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.734
I'm home.

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:16.785
Chi?

00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.328
Toru!

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.705
Whoa.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.083
Wow, you've gotten so big!

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.671
-Toru, it's you!
-Whoa!

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.965
Why are you here?
Are you on break?

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.301
I didn't hear anything
about you coming back.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.469
I'm sorry about that.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.722
Ryu, it's good to see you.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.434
I thought you were coming home tomorrow?

00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:42.186
I got off work early today.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:44.646
I see.

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:49.234
Shota!

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.028
You grew your hair out.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.696
Toru.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.407
You have your friends over?

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.826
They're our classmates.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.495
Let me introduce them.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.747
This is Yano, and this is Sawako.

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:03.749
Nice to meet you.

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:05.459
Nice to meet you too.

00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.169
You're so handsome.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.504
Hey, Yano!

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.716
Why did you come home so suddenly?

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.010
You didn't give me time to get ready.

00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:19.431
Uh, just a second.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.058
Hmm?

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.063
What's the matter?
Come on in.

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:26.980
Okay.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.279
Good evening.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.493
Your girlfriend?

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:40.911
Hmm.

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.705
Yes, we're getting married.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.841
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Haruka Katayama.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.472
Uh, good evening.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.059
Ah, Ryu.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:17.197
This is Ryu, my brother.
He's a freshman in high school.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.909
I'm his younger brother, Ryu.
It's nice to meet you.

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:23.579
-It's nice to meet you too.
-Oh!

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:27.207
Now let me introduce her too.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:30.002
This is Chizuru Yoshida. I call her Chi.

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.547
She's been like a little sister to me
since we were younger.

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.800
I'm Katayama. Nice to meet you.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.929
I'm Yoshida, their neighbor.

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.183
It's not like I'm family
or a relative or anything.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:47.102
Chi, don't be like that.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:58.280
Ryu, let's call it a day, okay?

00:19:58.989 --> 00:19:59.865
Oh.

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:01.533
Sure.

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:03.577
Your brother's home, after all.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.996
Yoshida, you guys should go too.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.832
Yeah, totally.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.501
Today is a special day.

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:13.128
Hmm.

00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:15.964
-Shall we get going?
-Sure.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.218
See you.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:20.302
Mmm.

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:28.518
Bye.

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.979
Come on!
My pity party's already over?

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.481
-See you.
-See you.

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.398
See you.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:34.983
-Bye.
-Chi.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.695
Be careful, okay?

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.740
You never change. I live right there.

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.242
See you.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:02.010
There!
You're stuck, aren't you?

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.178
I'm all done!

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.764
I guess I'm in first place once again!

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.892
That's the fourth win in a row.

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:12.062
What should we do next?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.233
We already played old maid.

00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:19.152
Are you all right, Chizu?

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.446
What are you talking about?

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.949
Oh, Toru?

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:27.911
I haven't even congratulated him yet.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:33.500
I mean, maybe I'll go see him tomorrow.

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:36.295
The guy I've always looked up to
is getting married.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.754
That's right.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.591
I mean, I always knew
he never saw me that way.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.471
He's found happiness,
so he deserves my blessings.

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:50.058
You're right! And there's
someone better out there for you.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.862
You're right!
Yes, you're right.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.365
I'm sorry for making things
awkward for you two.

00:22:05.866 --> 00:22:09.202
This is supposed to be
a pity party for you, Yano.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:10.912
It's okay, I don't need one.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.332
I've already forgotten all about it.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:14.875
Mmm.

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:16.501
Want to play again?

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.378
But you two are so weak.

00:22:18.462 --> 00:22:19.963
But you still had fun.

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.673
Come on, let's play.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.843
Oh, look at the time.
Should we get some sleep?

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.414
Thank you for spending time with me.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:55.457
Sure.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.002
Isn't this sweater great?

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.338
It has holes here, but they come in handy.

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:03.507
Mmm.

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.759
I'll go see Toru now.

00:23:05.842 --> 00:23:06.885
See you at school.

00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:09.262
Mmm, see you.

00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.389
See you.

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:25.570
I expected Chizu to make a bigger scene.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.952
I thought she'd scream

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.372
and cry like usual.

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:43.547
Is there anything we can do?

00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:49.428
In the state she's in right now,
she won't even talk about it.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.098
There's nothing we can do.

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.190
Sawako?

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.902
The miniskirt.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:10.740
She was so excited to wear it.

00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:16.246
I couldn't…

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.040
…even say anything.

00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:24.045
I couldn't do anything for her.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.674
It was the same for me.

00:24:30.385 --> 00:24:31.970
At such a crucial time…

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:37.559
I didn't know what to say.

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:46.610
What are friends supposed to do
during times like these?

00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.002
Toru?

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:05.504
Hmm?

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:10.091
My dream is to become your bride one day.

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.347
-Let's go home.
-Mmm!

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.769
I guess
the bride in that dream…

00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:23.063
won't be me.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.698
You don't need to see me off.
It's cold out.

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.784
It's all right.
It's just right there.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.374
Thank you for having me.

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:45.085
Yeah, you're most welcome.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.046
Hey, kid, drive safely.

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:49.005
Mmm.

00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:51.091
We'll be back for New Year's Day.

00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:52.384
Mmm.

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:53.760
We'll see you next time.

00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:56.388
Sure. That sounds good.

00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:57.764
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:01.309
Hey, can you go ahead?

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:06.940
Chi, uh, didn't come back.

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:08.692
No.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:12.404
She's at that age where she's always busy
and has her own life.

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:17.450
Ryu, you'll tell her
to join us next time, won't you?

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.288
Okay, I will.

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.435
TO RYU

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.417
Oh, Ryu.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.793
You're late.

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:10.503
Hmm?

00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:16.217
My brother told me
to tell you to join us next time.

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.347
He left around noon.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.478
I know that!

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:32.776
Are you being considerate
or insensitive, huh?

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:33.818
Considerate?

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.030
You were so considerate that

00:27:37.113 --> 00:27:40.158
you didn't tell me that Toru
was coming home, right?

00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:51.544
I wasn't being considerate.

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.425
I'm relieved…

00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.470
to finally see this happen.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.601
Now you can give up on him.

00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:25.620
How dare you?

00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:27.997
Idiot!

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:29.374
Baseball idiot!

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:38.049
Baseball has nothing to do with this.

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:59.821
BASEBALL IDIOT

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.370
JOE STRUCK OUT!
HE'LL BE ALONE FOR CHRISTMAS!

00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:09.664
To hell with it!

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:13.877
Let's gather single guys and girls
and have a Christmas party!

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.254
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:17.380
Yeah!

00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:32.687
TO SAWAKO

00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:41.362
When Chizu spews it out,

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.823
let's listen to her a lot.

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:45.492
And let's let her pout a lot.

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:00.298
I see.

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:03.384
That's why you two seemed down.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:04.928
Yeah.

00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:07.847
We don't know how she's feeling now.

00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:12.769
But we do know she isn't okay.

00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.062
And yet…

00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:15.605
Ugh!

00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:17.148
No use!

00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:19.734
We're totally useless!

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.196
Yoshida will be fine, I'm sure.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.324
Huh? Sounds like you don't care.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.952
I mean, she has you two.

00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:31.079
Were you listening to us?

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.039
We have no idea what to do.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:35.625
Mmm.

00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:38.461
But it doesn't really matter, does it?

00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:40.505
-What?
-Huh?

00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:41.798
I don't know.

00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:47.011
I'd feel supported if someone thinks of me
like that, you know?

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:53.184
I don't think you have to say something
when you don't know what to say.

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.980
I'm sure that's a necessary role.

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:02.610
How about you?

00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:06.072
Joe is heartbroken too, right?

00:31:06.781 --> 00:31:07.699
Me?

00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:12.078
I end up being so useless!

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:18.251
I was wondering
how he'd comfort them, but…

00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.254
-You're wise.
-…I see.

00:31:21.337 --> 00:31:23.423
You kind of made a point.

00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:25.508
Right?

00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:28.553
You once played Santa Claus before,
didn't you?

00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:30.763
Oh! Right, right, right, I did!

00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:33.892
When I said, "Merry Christmas,"
my beard completely came off.

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:34.976
It did!

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.561
I hurried to put it back…

00:31:36.644 --> 00:31:38.813
…but I was panicking.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.360
TO CHIZU
TO AYANE

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:56.122
I can't find
the right words to say,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.544
but I hope I find my role
that serves a purpose in all this.
