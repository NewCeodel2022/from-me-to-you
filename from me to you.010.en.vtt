WEBVTT

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:13.013
We're now third-year students,
and Kazehaya's 18th birthday has come.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.224
Kazehaya.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.435
Happy birthday.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.439
Thanks.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.819
I thought this would help
with your entrance exam studies.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.864
Thank you. I'll cherish it.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:32.532
Mmm.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:35.869
Oh.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.538
There's something else inside.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.622
TO KAZEHAYA

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.042
Oh, read that later when I'm not around!

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.045
I want to read it now.
Come on, face that way.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.679
"Kazehaya, happy birthday."

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.725
"I'm looking forward
to spending more fun days with you

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.561
whenever you're up for it."

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:08.860
"And when you're not,
please let me just stay by your side."

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.696
"Now that you're 18,

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.617
I pray that you can make
the best decisions for yourself."

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.454
"And that you'll be able to follow
whatever your heart desires."

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.374
"Thank you for always
being so kind to me."

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.295
"I love you. Sawako."

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.092
I read it.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.639
I look forward to it.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.727
I look forward to it too.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.701
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.515
SAPPORO UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:25.478
Kurumi, have you decided
on your first choice of school?

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.148
Mmm.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.569
I want to be a teacher.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.073
My mother, father, and grandmother
are teachers, and they also went there.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.370
I want to be a teacher too.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:49.752
With your grades, you'd get
into Sapporo University for sure.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.254
Mmm.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:53.756
I'm applying to a local university.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.216
What?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.217
Really?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.518
Sawako.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.562
Yes?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.066
Actually…

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.028
I'm worried.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.534
It won't be easy for me to pass.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.703
I might fail.

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.000
You might…

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.840
…not want to hear this from me…

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:42.013
…but would you mind studying
with me after school?

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.103
Could you help me
with the things I don't understand?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.982
Mmm.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.569
It'll give me a chance to review.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.030
And it'll also motivate me.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.498
KITAHORO GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.042
I want to apply to a university.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.506
I want to study
to become a sports trainer.

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.802
Still saying
such childish things?

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.597
University? A sports trainer?

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.724
Have you even studied for it?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.018
I'm taking a course specifically
for entrance exams.

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:31.813
That's not enough, you idiot!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.066
Hey, don't do that!

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.406
I told my father I want to go to college.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.743
So you were finally able to tell him, huh?

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.122
He didn't want to hear the details.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:55.003
But I'll show him that I'm serious
by studying at home.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.716
So we won't be able to spend
as much time together.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:02.468
I'm sorry.

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:05.888
Mm-mm. Not at all.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.682
You've given me strength.

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:09.350
Let's both study hard.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.602
Mmm. Thanks.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:14.772
Thank you too.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.989
Just add the numbers into this formula.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:23.906
See?

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:25.491
Got it.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.744
This is the first time
I'm able to solve such a problem.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.911
-Really?
-Mmm.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.080
It helps clarify things for me too.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:35.877
You two are commendable.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:40.089
Why? I have to study, or I won't pass.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.007
It's not that.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.469
I meant that you two already know what
you want to do and have set your goals.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.976
Isn't it scary aiming so high?

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.396
It motivates me to get there.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.941
And I want to prove myself.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.785
What a great day!

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.212
Ayane.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:25.093
Your acceptance is a done deal
based on your recommendations.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.304
Why are you so strung up?

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:35.812
If doing nothing makes you anxious,

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.316
is there some way
I can help you with that?

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.822
Oh, why don't we study together?
It just might help you make progress.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.866
Sorry, but I can't focus
unless I'm studying alone!

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.708
Sorry,
I… I didn't mean it that way.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.093
You know, Kento…

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.014
I feel lost.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:16.853
About what?

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:21.482
I always planned on choosing college
based on recommendations.

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:26.904
But…

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.616
…there's another university
I can't stop thinking about.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:32.535
Which one?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.331
Tokyo's…

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:40.877
Capital International University.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.054
I mean, it's maybe impossible for me.
It was just a thought.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.152
I…

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.490
I don't want to be away from you.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:15.953
So maybe…

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:18.748
I should go to Tokyo too.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.626
Why do you have to change
your path just for me?

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:25.171
Don't you have your own dreams?

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:27.924
If things don't go well,
is it going to be my fault?

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:34.889
Sorry.

00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:53.783
-It was delicious.
-Thank you very much!

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.495
Here's your beer.

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:58.746
Mmm! Thank you!

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.207
-Pin.
-Yeah?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.417
Will my son be all right?

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.380
Actually, a scout from a university
in Sapporo came again today.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.550
Is he really good enough
to play in college?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.010
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.513
Thanks.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.191
I heard…

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.906
your team won today too.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.618
We're aiming for the Koshien tournament.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.246
Right.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.133
Oh!

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:00.349
Ayane? Is something wrong?

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.019
Huh?

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:05.396
We can tell just by looking.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:08.482
And you're not eating with Kento today.
That's unusual.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.778
If you need someone to talk to,
we're here for you.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.493
Well…

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:26.709
I told Kento that I'm considering
a university in Tokyo.

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:32.757
But I thought you were recommended
the university in Sapporo.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.386
Actually…

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:42.183
I've always wanted to go to Tokyo.

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.436
Tokyo?

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:51.859
But you know…

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.988
when I thought about the school in Tokyo,

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.700
I didn't really think…

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:06.666
about being away from Kento,
or that it could break us up.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:09.794
Wait…

00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:12.588
Are you saying that…

00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:15.925
Kento…

00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:20.554
is serious about us.

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.103
And I'm not.

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:31.399
He's a good guy.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.780
It's the same old me.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:42.493
I did something horrible.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.502
I'm nothing like you two.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.591
I might have dated a lot,
but I don't know what love is.

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:01.303
What about us?

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.973
Don't you love us?

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.144
Of course I do!

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.603
Then you do know!

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:12.356
It's not romantic love.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.816
Yeah, but still!

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:19.280
I care for you, and you care for me.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.620
If you feel bad for Kento
for not being serious,

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.917
then you need to be true to who you are,
no matter what that means.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.688
Did you hear from Ayane?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.445
I guess…

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.240
Ayane never liked me.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:09.663
I think I always knew it, though.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.878
Ayane said that you're

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.172
a good guy.

00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:26.263
She's a kind person.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:29.892
Mmm.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.273
I know.

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:52.623
Did something happen with Miura?

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:03.092
He told me before

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.803
that you're thinking of a school in Tokyo.

00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:09.807
Because of me…

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.478
Kento is hurt.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.570
You can't stand a person like me.
Am I right?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.700
That's not true.

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:32.705
You have your own feelings,

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.791
and Miura has his own.

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.131
It was fun being with Kento.

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.342
He made me feel at ease.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.138
But…

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.144
Ayane.

00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.063
Let's break up.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.276
Kento.

00:15:06.196 --> 00:15:07.948
About the school in Tokyo…

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.118
I kept you from being open about it.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.079
I'm sorry.

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.335
No, Kento.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.588
I couldn't tell you because I was scared.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.966
I didn't tell you, although I should have.

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.263
You're kind…

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:33.599
Ayane.

00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.311
I'm not.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.774
I'm not kind at all.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.364
Yes, you are.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:55.704
You are…

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:58.415
very kind.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.504
Kento.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.260
I'm sorry I couldn't love you.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:18.936
Ayane.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.440
Do you regret dating me?

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.322
No one has ever cherished me like you did.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.911
Don't forget…

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.665
that I really loved you.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:50.926
Being with you…

00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:58.308
…made me so happy.

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:14.742
Oh, hey.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.827
It's unusual to see you here.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.878
You have no regrets, right?

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:33.469
Honestly,

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.973
do you think there's anyone who doesn't?

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.852
Even hard workers,

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:45.439
despite all their effort,
they still have regrets.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.402
What's wrong with making mistakes?

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:52.821
Embrace them.

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:55.365
And make them count.

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:02.372
I…

00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:12.257
I won't take the recommendation.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.930
I'll apply to…

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:20.766
CIU.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:25.813
Okay.

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:27.439
Study hard.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:29.108
I will.

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:41.703
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.374
-Ayane.
-Hmm?

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.209
You like cafés, right?

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:48.252
I do.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.963
So, they really broke up.

00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:54.842
Mmm, that's true.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.052
But they still cherish each other.

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:01.974
Sawako, you're staying here, right?

00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.768
Ever thought about
being away from Kazehaya?

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:07.396
Why do you suddenly ask?

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.859
Ryu is probably going
to school in Sapporo.

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:12.776
Huh?

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:17.030
I think he'll continue baseball
in college.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:43.140
Chizuru, thank you for always
taking care of the shop.

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:46.268
Why so suddenly?

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:52.024
I couldn't say this,
but I knew you were worried about me.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:57.863
I'll get the result.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:00.324
I'll win.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.165
Thank you for always cheering me on.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.584
Since we were kids.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:22.429
Don't go.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.892
Don't go to college.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.353
I can't…

00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:39.279
I can't…

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:42.741
I can't cheer for you.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:45.911
Don't go!

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.748
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.459
Don't go!

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.794
Don't go!

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:55.587
Chizuru.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.095
Just kidding.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.974
Go.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.645
Chizuru, do you like me?

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:13.981
Do you?

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.777
I do, idiot!

00:21:58.066 --> 00:22:01.403
Uh, I'm sorry we can't go
to Sanada's game today.

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:06.366
Oh yeah. They'll make it
to the finals if they win, right?

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:11.413
I'm… I'm horrible.

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:13.582
Hmm?

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.419
Right now,

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:21.381
I can't cheer for him wholeheartedly.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.011
What's that?

00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:32.684
The game's started.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.228
The score's still 0-0.

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:39.232
Yoshida?

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:50.702
Kazehaya.

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:58.502
Would you still be able to cheer on Sawako
even if she were away?

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.966
Don't underestimate me.

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:30.826
KITAHORO VS OBIHIRONISHI 0 - 0
BOTTOM OF THE 2ND

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:46.174
I want to cheer him on
more than anyone else.

00:23:47.717 --> 00:23:49.010
I do, but…

00:23:50.887 --> 00:23:52.973
Go, Ryu! Go!

00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.190
Go, Ryu! Go!

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:14.119
Her car skidded
when she went to pick up her younger son.

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:17.622
She couldn't see ahead
because of the bad snow storm.

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.917
-How unfortunate. So sad.
-I feel so sorry.

00:24:37.767 --> 00:24:40.020
No matter
how tough things were,

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:42.606
you overcame them quietly.

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:46.735
The one I love…

00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:49.362
will always be you.

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:53.700
Always.

00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.161
Only you.

00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:18.600
KITAHORO VS OBIHIRONISHI 1 - 4
BOTTOM OF THE 7TH

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.252
Hear me, God!

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.712
I'm sorry!

00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:49.297
I'll do anything!

00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:53.843
Ryu is sincere, devoted, and kind!

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:56.179
KITAHORO: 1 - OBIHIRONISHI: 4
TOP OF THE 9TH

00:25:56.263 --> 00:25:57.222
Thank you.

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.564
He never blames others.

00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:10.443
He just keeps working quietly.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.196
So…

00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:17.576
let him play as many games as possible!

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:26.334
Go, Ryu! Go!

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:33.883
Go!

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.321
BASEBALL IDIOT

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:14.674
It's over.

00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:16.843
It is.

00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:22.807
No, it's not!

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.811
It continues in college!

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:30.315
Ryu.

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:33.234
I'll be here.

00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:37.822
I'll be here no matter what.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.162
So…

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:49.250
…just go,
and don't worry about a thing.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.006
If anything happens,

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.510
please come back to me.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:06.726
You've comforted me so much until now.

00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.481
So I'll be comforting you from now on.

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.986
And if something happens to you?

00:28:18.446 --> 00:28:20.782
Huh? I can take care of myself--

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.876
I'll come right back.

00:28:34.087 --> 00:28:35.422
I'll be back for sure.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:38.925
And then we can become a family.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:44.931
Mmm.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.231
Let's run the shop together.

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:55.734
Mmm.

00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:12.625
Chizu made up her mind.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.423
Ayane has also started
walking toward her dream.

00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:22.927
I…

00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:38.568
Kurumi is amazing.
She's doing better on her mock exams.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.488
You too, right?

00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:44.449
Mmm.

00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:49.496
Aren't you tired?

00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:51.164
You can rest.

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:53.082
This is reserved only for you.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:01.216
Time's flown by since we started dating.

00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:03.510
Mmm.

00:30:04.177 --> 00:30:06.930
Kazehaya, even though we're together now,

00:30:07.013 --> 00:30:10.600
I still can't believe
you ever fell in love with me.

00:30:10.683 --> 00:30:12.477
Me neither.

00:30:15.438 --> 00:30:18.274
Even if you did like someone else,

00:30:19.442 --> 00:30:21.694
I knew I would still love you.

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:25.990
But in college,

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.828
there might be
someone who's closer to you.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.080
Someone who's nicer to you.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.958
Someone I don't know.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.337
Someone who also likes you.

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:45.176
Even though we'll be in the same school?

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:47.220
In college,

00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:50.890
there are so many more people.

00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:53.560
You'll be surrounded by strangers.

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:57.730
Oh, I see.

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:16.541
So you've decided
Sapporo University of Education, right?

00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:17.458
What?

00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:21.921
You've been studying so hard.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:26.634
It doesn't necessarily mean that.

00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:28.970
It doesn't?

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.396
I've been thinking…

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.236
that it's where you really want to go.

00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.449
It's…

00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:52.869
You'll… You'll be fine.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.248
You'll be fine in a new place.

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.002
Kazehaya.
