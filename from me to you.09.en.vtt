WEBVTT

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.640
Can you imagine how much I love you?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.315
From the beginning,
you were different from anyone else.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.484
Kuronuma,

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.945
ever since I met you,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.114
you've been…

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.576
deep in my heart.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.457
I really wanted to cherish you.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.629
But when we're together,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.383
I lose control of myself.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.262
I got selfish and greedy.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.729
I could end up hurting you

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.316
more than anyone else.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.531
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm horrible.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.258
Didn't you realize
I can only be hurt by you?

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.972
It's because my heart
responds only to you.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:45.396
The one I fight or get awkward with

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.941
has to be you.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.252
Maybe I've been
admiring you too much.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.671
Merry Christmas.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:11.673
Merry Christmas.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.052
I thought
once I got close to you,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.097
I wouldn't feel distant from you.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:24.144
I'm seeing a side of myself
I didn't know before.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.771
What?

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:33.319
I'm sorry for calling you a liar.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:35.989
Mmm.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:38.908
Let's go.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.496
I was wrong.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.664
The more I love you,

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.459
the more I struggle with our distance,

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.837
with your gestures,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.465
and with the slightest changes
in your expressions.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:08.313
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.941
New Year's Day.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.402
-We all went to the shrine together.
-Mmm!

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:16.779
Ramen after a shrine visit is the best!

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.865
-Mmm!
-Mmm!

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.200
By the way,

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.161
I never expected
you and Kento would be dating.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.332
He's kind and nice.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.335
Mmm.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.966
Is he really a teacher?

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:42.055
Actually, he was scouted
by baseball teams in high school.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.431
Oh, by college teams?

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.891
Mm-mm, professional teams.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.226
What? Professional?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.480
My brother said he used to be a hero.
He was so popular back then.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.315
Then why did he become a teacher?

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.608
Not sure.

00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:55.860
It seems he turned down the scouts.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.405
Actually, I chose this school
because of him.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.408
After all, he's very caring.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.786
He's looked after me
ever since I was little.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.665
He seems like he doesn't see anything,

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.918
but he observes each of us very carefully.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.799
I'll never forget what he said to me.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.177
I respect him.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.683
Did someone just show respect to me?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.977
He's up. Ugh.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.395
I…

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.272
I respect you.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.607
Respect, huh?

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.484
As you should.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.319
Mmm.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.655
Time to go.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.075
Hey, you guys should go home too.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.536
Huh? How selfish.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.037
-By the way…
-It was delicious.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.207
…there'll be
a career counseling meeting next semester.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.334
It's your future.
Think about it carefully.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.128
-I will.
-Good.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.046
-It's okay.
-Thanks.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.548
Oh, Kuronuma!

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.259
I'll give you an assignment.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.886
Before the meeting,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.348
think about as many future possibilities
as you can.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.935
It can even be a fantasy
or whatever. Dream big.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.520
-Okay.
-Good.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.987
Our futures
are approaching faster than I expected.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.906
It's raining so much!

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.366
Future career, huh?

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.494
Mmm, it's that time.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.455
Hmm.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.914
We need to think carefully.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.500
Mmm, that's right.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.590
WIND SPORTS

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.470
Shota, I'm out on a delivery.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.972
Once you get home,
shovel the snow in front of the store.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:49.390
Okay.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.977
-Oh, it's my dad.
-What? Your father?

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.896
Hmm. Who are you?

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.274
Oh, well, I…

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.361
She's my classmate Sawako Kuronuma.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.112
We're dating.

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.490
Dating?!

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:10.453
First of all, I asked her who she is.
Why did you answer?

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.913
Don't talk like that.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:13.831
Oh.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.585
I'm sorry, but let me introduce myself.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:19.379
Go ahead.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.381
Nice to meet you.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.802
I'm Shota's classmate, Sawako Kuronuma.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.182
My dad is a civil servant,
and my mom is a housewife.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.268
I mainly take care of
the flower beds at school.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.108
Are you eating properly?

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.653
Eat more! Here!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.196
Thank you.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.825
Shota, go home
and shovel the snow right away.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.160
Okay.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.921
Your dad seems dignified.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.048
Dignified?

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.219
I guess that's one way to say it.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.513
Huh?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.434
He seems to like you.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.814
What? His fierce dad likes you?

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.232
F… Fierce?

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.693
His dad is so strict.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.738
His dad is always so hard on him.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.992
-Really?
-Mmm, he's very short-tempered.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.204
Being his daughter-in-law
is going to be tough.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.831
D… Daughter-in-law?

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.834
Daughter-in-law.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.755
-Excuse me.
-Hey, Kuronuma.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.635
You didn't dare to write "bride," did you?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.597
No, of course not.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.973
-Here it is.
-Mmm.

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:56.809
CAREER PATH SURVEY

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.187
1. CIVIL SERVANT (LOCAL)
2. OFFICE WORKER (LOCAL)

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.855
3. SOCIAL WORKER (LOCAL)
SAWAKO KURONUMA

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:03.524
Did you really think
about this carefully? Hmm?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.442
Huh?

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.027
Come on.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.447
Have you never really considered
what it is that you want to be?

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.993
What have you been thinking about?

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.415
I was always occupied
with what was in front of me.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.919
1. RAMEN (DON'T KNOW)
2. DON'T KNOW

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:24.128
3. DON'T KNOW
CHIZURU YOSHIDA

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.590
Well, I wouldn't care
if you wanted to work at a ramen shop.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.051
I'm not working at a ramen shop!

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.221
Although I thought about it before.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.390
I don't know yet.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:38.392
1-3. HOKURYO UNIVERSITY
AYANE YANO

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.313
Hmm. I think you could get in
with your scores.

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:43.231
Anywhere else?

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.315
None.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.736
Look, don't worry. I won't aim too high.

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:50.404
Ayane…

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:55.785
playing it safe is fine, but have you
ever poured yourself into anything?

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:59.080
Academics, sports, romance, anything?

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.333
Weren't you scared of failing too?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.918
Huh?

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.129
You could have been
a professional baseball player, right?

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.091
But you played it safe
and became a teacher, didn't you?

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:13.094
Ah, you don't know anything.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.598
I just wanted to play baseball.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.103
To be on that field once more.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.148
Okay!

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.651
Okay, first! Okay!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.945
Okay!

00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:38.828
Ah, Sapporo sounds good!

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.372
Then I'll go to Sapporo too.

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:43.833
You're so positive.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.795
I'm excited to graduate.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.674
I'm gonna keep cherishing you.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.385
Cherish?

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.764
You already do.

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.101
I'll cherish you
even more than now.

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.604
Let's live together someday, Ayane.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.608
Let's get married someday.

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:16.741
Do you guys know what you're
going to do after graduation?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.076
No, not at all.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.078
Why don't you work for Ryu's shop?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.122
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:26.709
Huh. All I know is
that I'll stay in the area.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.754
Chizu, you're staying too?

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.255
-Huh?
-What?

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.132
You're sticking around here?

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:37.178
Yes. I'm thinking of getting a job.

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:39.388
Why? It's such a waste.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.349
You could get into a really good school.

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:45.394
I didn't really think about it.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.064
Really? You looked like you did.

00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:49.940
How about you, Yano?

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.818
I'll go to university in Sapporo.
Kento too.

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:54.987
So it's Sapporo, after all.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.864
Come visit me with Sawako.

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:59.450
But I'll still miss you.

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:00.660
Really?

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.705
You'll make lots of friends there
and forget about us, won't you?

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.876
-You'll miss me? How cute.
-Oh, shut up!

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:11.837
They're all thinking
about the future.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:16.676
I've never thought
of being away from anyone.

00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.597
Hmm? What's wrong?

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.891
Sawako?

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.562
I'm a bit sad…

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.816
-…but they're all moving forward.
-You're so funny!

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.775
-Come on.
-Huh?

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.235
-Nothing.
-Really?

00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:35.778
Be careful, it's hot.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.738
-Okay.
-Here.

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:40.074
Here you go.

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:42.034
-Thanks.
-Let's eat.

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.454
A ramen shop is a great fit for her,
don't you think?

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.998
You come here way too often.

00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:56.799
What made you become a teacher?

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:58.134
Huh?

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.011
Was there a teacher you respected?

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.931
Huh. You could say I did.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.393
My high school baseball coach
was also a teacher.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.894
Hmm.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.398
So you respected him?

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.817
I didn't become a teacher
to be respected.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.778
I'd rather be envied than respected.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.447
Mmm.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.324
Do you enjoy teaching?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:25.119
I have nothing to teach.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.998
Hey, the noodles are going to get soggy!

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.131
It's fun to watch you guys.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:41.135
-Okay.
-You're all stupid and do silly things.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.137
I won't ever get bored.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.346
-Yes, three.
-Okay.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.933
I'm excited to see how you guys will grow.

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.144
Pot stickers, rice…

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:51.604
Um…

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.735
Kuronuma,
you're far more capable than you think.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.447
Wherever you are,
whatever you do, you will excel.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.449
-It’s miso ramen.
-You're remarkable.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:06.327
I'd recommend…

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.288
Have you ever given up
because you thought that

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.500
you couldn't do something or fit in?

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.169
And also pot stickers.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:17.588
Yano…

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:20.466
you're just getting started.

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:22.259
What?

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.220
Listen,

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:30.017
what matters most of all is understanding
what your heart truly desires.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.561
That'll never change

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:35.731
regardless of what you do.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.488
ONE GOOD DEED A DAY

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.371
Have you ever given up

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:54.041
because you thought
you couldn't do something or fit in?

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.044
I think it suits you.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:58.587
You're natural at teaching others.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.714
Wow!

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:20.901
Kazehaya.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:25.489
Is it okay if I wait for you until
your parent-teacher conference ends?

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.408
You sure? Thanks.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.372
You idiot!

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:40.004
Don't come home until you cool off first!

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.756
H… Hello.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.133
Oh, uh…

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.303
That idiot thinks
he's on top of the world.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:51.807
Do not let
that idiot get all cocky!

00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:59.773
Kazehaya, what happened?

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:04.737
I said I wanted to take over his business,
and he punched me.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.365
You and your parents
need to do some more talking.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:15.915
Excuse me.

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:25.257
I decided to take over
his business on my own.

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:28.761
But I thought he would be happy.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:30.846
He's mad.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:32.932
Why?

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.644
He doesn't like whatever I do.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:39.229
Nothing.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.358
Nothing I ever do has ever pleased him.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.443
Huh?

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.363
He's always been like that.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:50.741
Dad!

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.368
What is it?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.453
It's Father's Day. This is for you.

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:55.371
Here.

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.705
SHOULDER MASSAGE COUPONS
15 MINUTES

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.712
Forget about this, and do your homework!

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:08.926
The last time I made him crazy mad
was when I quit baseball in eighth grade.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.471
He was the coach of the team.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.685
He yelled,
"You're half-assed at everything."

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:22.982
Why did you quit baseball?

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.989
Mom has a chronic illness.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.493
She was often hospitalized
when I was in middle school.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:40.541
I thought joining the high school
baseball team would take over my life.

00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:45.546
I wanted to be at home
in case something happened.

00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:54.013
I wanted to be equal to Dad,

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.682
but I couldn't.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:03.522
He saw right through it.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:09.153
Me saying I'd take over his business
out of spite.

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.612
It's laughable, really.

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:12.990
No, it's not.

00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:14.950
It's really not.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:23.709
You weren't lying when you told me
you wanted to be home for your mom, right?

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.298
You two give full
and serious attention to each other.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:30.924
Both you…

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.218
and your dad.

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:35.721
Dad too?

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:41.393
He told you to do as you'd like, right?

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:47.024
I believe he has
your best interests at heart.

00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:54.782
I've never thought of it like that.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.965
How about you?
Have you found what you want to do?

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:14.551
I…

00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:21.350
I want to be a teacher.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.898
That desire's been deep in my heart.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:40.536
You always try to help others
understand something.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.747
Not only when you teach,

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.042
but also when you're with your friends.

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.461
So…

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:51.839
it suits you.

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:58.554
Thanks.

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:02.307
I wanted to tell you first.

00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:13.652
-Oh, still here?
-Hi.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.321
Your shift is over,
but you're still working?

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:18.782
Thanks, as always.

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:19.783
Not at all.

00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:23.287
All right.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.880
-Pops?
-Hmm?

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:34.882
Let's say…

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.217
This is just a "what-if."

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.178
Hmm?

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:45.934
Would you agree if I asked you
to hire me as a full-time employee?

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.813
You're always welcome here.

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:52.191
Really? Are you exaggerating?

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.942
No, no, not at all!

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.068
I'd love it.

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.325
Thank you, Chizu.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.625
After all these years running the shop,

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.212
I'm getting lonely at this age.

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:16.131
Why? You have us.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.343
Oh, that's reassuring.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.154
You've been running a lot lately.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:46.745
Take care of the shop
until I graduate from the team.

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:48.455
I'm the captain, after all.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:50.707
This is your last year, huh?

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:55.254
Chizuru, thank you.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.798
What?

00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:01.009
Are you okay with your studies
since you're always working?

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:05.180
Well, barely.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.975
You studied the most
before getting into high school.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.185
Because I really wanted to pass.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.479
My brother had already graduated, though.

00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:13.438
Huh?

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.733
Why do you think I wanted
to get into Kitahoro High?

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:22.364
I mean, it's because it's
my brother's alma mater, right?

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.118
Because you were going, obviously.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.122
If I'd gone to a different school…

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.252
while you went to Kitahoro High,
we'd get separated.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:40.465
I wouldn't have been able to cheer for you
if our teams played against each other.

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.593
I would have hated it.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.766
I always wanted to cheer for you.

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:52.311
More than anyone else.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:55.856
Chizuru.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.736
What?

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.404
Don't look at me, stupid!

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:06.575
Thank you.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:10.412
So just…

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.040
…work hard!

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.128
I will!

00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:21.590
Did you cool off, son? Hmm?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.552
Taking over what I built over many years
is asking too much!

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:26.678
Hey, honey.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:30.599
You're using family as an excuse
because you haven't given it much thought.

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.392
Your mom's health
has nothing to do with you!

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:35.562
What? Of course it does!
Why wouldn't it affect me?

00:22:35.645 --> 00:22:36.980
Don't be cheeky!

00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:39.232
-First of all, you're still--
-Hey! The food is ready.

00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.151
Let's enjoy it.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.195
Let's eat.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.626
With her grades, she'll most likely pass.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:58.668
Do you think so?

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.296
But, Yano,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.549
is this really the college
you want to go to?

00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:11.848
Didn't you set your limit
far lower than it actually is?

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.103
Ms. Yano,

00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:19.606
she has more room to grow.

00:23:25.153 --> 00:23:29.616
Ayane, is there
another school you want to go to?

00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:34.913
Since you were little,
you were always careful,

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:38.834
played safe, and didn't take risks.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.338
I've always done…

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.091
…what I wanted.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.679
I got the job I wanted
and married the man I loved.

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:54.307
Of course, I get frustrated
with many things, but…

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.813
I kind of admire that.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:01.898
It's quite fun.

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.113
Think carefully.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:10.866
Okay. I'll go to work now.

00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:17.289
Squeeze your elbows, right?

00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:18.248
WIND SPORTS

00:24:18.331 --> 00:24:21.126
That lowers your center of gravity
and stabilizes your head.

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:22.752
-Yes.
-Then…

00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:23.753
I'm home.

00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:25.464
-Hello!
-Hey.

00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:28.925
From here, lead with the elbow
towards the ball quickly.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.719
Ah, one more time.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:33.180
-Your elbow takes the shortest path.
-Okay.

00:24:33.263 --> 00:24:34.514
-One more time.
-Yes.

00:24:34.598 --> 00:24:36.475
Your elbow takes the shortest path.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:38.351
-Got it.
-All right.

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.270
Sota, you're up next.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.981
MEIKA UNIVERSITY - ECONOMICS
DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:50.822
Hey.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.868
Are you looking for something?

00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:57.120
-Kind of.
-Mmm.

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:02.334
Did you give up taking over the business?

00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:04.878
No, I'm still planning to help.

00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:08.798
You mean you'll study at college
while helping?

00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:16.973
Isn't there a way to study
in order to take over the business?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.101
You'll figure it out.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:36.034
I'm thinking of going to college.

00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:40.163
I'm thinking of applying there too.

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.165
Hmm.

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:44.876
They have a sports science course.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:50.382
I… I wanted to study about sports.

00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:53.843
I'm still researching.

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:56.096
I don't really know
what's out there for me.

00:25:57.597 --> 00:25:59.391
But I just wanted to tell you.

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:04.354
Then we'll apply for the same school.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:05.981
Mmm.

00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:10.235
You know,

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:15.031
I think… I think I'll be here forever.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.909
I really believe

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.037
that's what will happen.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:25.083
Mmm.

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.129
But honestly,

00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:31.381
I thought…

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:34.843
I thought you'd leave here
to go to a good school.

00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:43.101
I was…

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:45.937
I was sure you'd leave.

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:50.150
Leave?

00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:53.737
Leave my family, hometown, and you?

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:58.742
It wasn't an option.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.911
Mmm.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:12.964
I think
I'll be here forever too.

00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:17.469
In this scenery and with Kazehaya.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:23.058
I hope I can stay with him forever.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.560
KITAHORO GAKUIN UNIVERSITY

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:28.563
One more year.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.649
-Yes.
-Mmm.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.027
Yano, what do you
want to study in college?

00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.280
Hmm…

00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:39.366
Well, I don't really know yet.

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:42.911
But I want to go abroad someday.

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:46.873
I want to see something new.

00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:51.544
I want to see
so many things I haven't seen.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.758
I want to be able to do
so many things by myself.

00:27:58.259 --> 00:27:59.135
So…

00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:07.519
I want to…

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.648
leave here.

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.402
Hmm. Well, Yano, you're…

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.322
Have you ever struggled?

00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:21.533
Even you, Pin?

00:28:22.784 --> 00:28:23.702
Mmm.

00:28:24.494 --> 00:28:26.454
Yes, in my high school days.

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.750
It's because your choices
lead you to a certain future.

00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:33.211
Don't say such scary things.

00:28:33.294 --> 00:28:34.295
Scary?

00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:37.006
Hmm. Yeah, I guess it is.

00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:40.051
But that's why it's exciting.

00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:42.971
Don't you want to choose
something more exciting?

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:47.642
Hey…

00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:53.732
What do you think of me?

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.443
Huh?

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:59.988
Oh, not in that way!

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.156
What do you mean?

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.574
What I meant was…

00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:04.117
Ugh.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.167
What do you think of this college?

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:16.796
Tokyo, huh?

00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:22.010
And?

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.346
What do you want to hear?

00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:32.604
The reality is
that you must work really hard.

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:44.199
You are such a child.

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.243
People always say I'm mature!

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:52.499
Rest assured, you're still a kid.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:56.628
You can still behave recklessly.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.193
CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY (CIU)

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.704
You're aiming to be a teacher, right?

00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:33.748
Yes.

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:37.919
Then why aren't you considering
teacher training or majoring in education?

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:40.380
Is it because
you don't want to leave here?

00:30:46.594 --> 00:30:49.264
You're serious about
becoming a teacher, right?

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.851
The school you chose
does offer teaching licenses.

00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:56.980
But… But with your grades,
you could aim higher.

00:30:58.314 --> 00:31:00.692
So this is the school I recommend.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.114
It's a national school.
Sapporo University of Education.

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:07.240
Sapporo…

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.883
Kazehaya.

00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:37.562
Kuronuma…

00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:46.738
Kazehaya.
