WEBVTT

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.640
WE'RE CHANGING SEATS!

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.809
Pick a number.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.605
Hey, it's Sadako's turn.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.523
Sadako…

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.694
-What number?
-Your seat is there.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:28.778
Wait, where is it?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.240
Huh?

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.159
-What? The back?
-The end of the row?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.202
No way!

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.665
The seat next to her is 19!
Nineteen! Nineteen!

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.084
-Please don't give me 19.
-Pick a number.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:44.669
What number?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:47.672
No! It's 19! No way!

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.008
I'm a little hurt.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.428
Can I trade with number 19?

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.356
Great, we're next to each other.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.404
You can have it back.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.366
-Yoshida, you're up next.
-Yup. No, thanks.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.497
Move it, Ryu.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.333
No. I like the corner by the window.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:29.672
And here we are.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.383
That's Ryu. We're childhood friends.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.677
Uh…

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.806
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.354
Huh? What's with that look?

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.982
If I relax my eyebrows,

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.318
I'll cry.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.198
You looked so unhappy for a moment.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.534
Smile when you're happy.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.662
I'm…

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.707
so happy to get this seat

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.544
from the bottom of my heart.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:18.972
I'm so hungry.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.349
Your bento looks so good!

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.393
Wow, it does!

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.687
-Bring your desk over.
-Sure.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.981
-You too, Sadako.
-Huh?

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.065
Over here.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.410
My dream is about to come true.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.872
Only salad again?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.544
I went to the same middle school
as Kazehaya and Ryu.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.213
Chizu and I became friends here.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.924
-Chizu and Ryu are childhood friends.
-Mmm.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.218
So that's why you're all so close.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.473
Although,
I saw you talking normally to Kazehaya.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.225
Mmm.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.436
He treats me like he treats others.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.439
I'm really thankful beyond words.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.650
He's been Mr. Pleasant
since middle school.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.360
He's always been like that?

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.487
You know it, yup.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.906
He never leaves anyone out,

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.533
and he's always the leader
amongst the guys.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:25.205
He's so popular that the girls
were fighting over him in middle school.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.333
But he doesn't like girls who quarrel.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:34.297
So they made a pact calling him
"Everybody's Kazehaya."

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.258
-How ridiculous!
-Right?

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.551
So get this.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.470
Those girls still come to see him.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.680
-Kazehaya!
-Like her…

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.516
This is the one you wanted to listen to.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.018
-I can borrow it?
-Hmm.

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:49.020
-Seriously? Thanks.
-Sure.

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.230
He's amazing.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.608
Amazing?

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:57.487
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I wanna know too.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.493
I make soba noodles in my free time.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.913
-Soba? What a weird hobby.
-Soba?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:16.923
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.933
Kazehaya.

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.935
You're still working on
the roll call sheet?

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.020
Let me help so we can finish it quickly.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.983
-Thank you, as always.
-Mmm.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.570
You're amazing.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.824
You're always inspiring others.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:51.207
It's thanks to your help, Kazehaya,
that I had such a great day.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.128
I didn't do anything.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.300
I just created an opportunity.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.469
There might be others who are just…

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.806
waiting for the chance to talk with you.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.314
Should I continue this?

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:15.898
Oh, mmm.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.776
Thanks.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.290
SAWAKO KURONUMA

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.267
Freshman, Class D,

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.395
Shota Kazehaya,
come to the staff room right away.

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:59.776
Shota Kazehaya, come within a minute,
or I'll expose all of your shameful past!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.195
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.946
Mmm.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.001
Oh.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.420
We thought Kazehaya was here.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.132
There might be others

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.843
who are just waiting
for the chance to talk with you.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:31.682
If you'd like, we can have a chat.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.934
Oh, no, thanks!

00:06:39.273 --> 00:06:41.067
We'll do it ourselves.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.073
Let us help since you're always
taking on school chores by yourself.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.826
I was also worried
about the seat arrangement anyway.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:55.873
Why are you crying?

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.002
I'm just happy.

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.798
Don't cry.

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.842
It's okay.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.887
STAFF ROOM

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.514
Oh, all finished?

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:16.018
Mmm, Hirano and Endo helped me.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.896
Really? That's great!

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.316
Ah, sorry I couldn't help at all.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:24.026
Mm-mm.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.405
Thank you.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.328
Your words, they always inspire me.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.915
Don't you get it?

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:43.004
Yano, Yoshida, Hirano, and Endo

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.382
were all moved by your hard work.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.260
And they weren't alone.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.679
I was moved too.

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.444
QUIET DURING SELF-STUDY

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:09.071
Why isn't this "when" translated?

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.825
Because it functions as an adjective

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.287
and comes right after a noun
to describe time.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.334
The same rule is applied with a noun
that describes a period of time.

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.252
You should learn them together.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.298
Wow, you two actually study
during self-study time?

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.217
She's really good at teaching.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.384
Oh.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.471
Wow, Sadako, you're a good teacher.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.181
You think so?

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:36.807
Why don't you have her help you too?

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:39.685
Then help me with this, Sadako.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.605
Okay. Then… Then how about this one?

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.607
The hypotenuse equals one.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.277
I see!
That's why it's the square root of two!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.779
Mmm, that's right.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.365
Wow, I finally get it!

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:54.825
You then apply this formula and…

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.203
I get it!

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:58.538
Ooh!

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.123
-Amazing!
-That's awesome!

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.793
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.754
I was useful.

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.341
You're so off, as usual!

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.555
Am I?

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.894
It doesn't do any good for Kazehaya
to hang out with her.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.479
-Oh, you're right!
-True.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.816
Yoshida in Class D used to be so wild.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:30.111
Making teachers cry
and hitting all the boys in her class.

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:31.028
-Oh.
-For real?

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:32.697
Did you hear?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.409
Yoshida used to be a punk
and was even sent to a reform school.

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:39.245
-Seriously?
-Her friend Yano is a man-eater,

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:42.081
and uses all kinds of skills
to knock off a hundred men.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.499
That's crazy.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.085
Oh?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.878
Who said that?

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.798
Oh, I… I mean…

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.092
Who said that?

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.553
I mean, everyone…

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.889
I'm asking who started it!

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.895
Sa… Sadako.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.106
Huh?

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.357
Sadako did?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.358
Why?

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:14.989
She's using you two and Kazehaya
to bring up her status.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.158
Sadako?

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.743
She's using us?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.879
-That's absurd!
-Seriously.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.672
I never went to a reform school.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.674
And I never knocked off a hundred men.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.093
What was the actual number?

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.888
Hey, don't join them, Chizu!

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:41.724
Yoshida, Yano, morning.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:42.683
Morning.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:48.147
I summarized the points
for the midterm exams, so if you want…

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.398
EXAM SUMMARY NOTES FOR YOSHIDA

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.442
Seriously? Thanks!

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.029
-Wow, amazing!
-Whoa!

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.702
Should we ask her just in case?

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.456
Sadako…

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.834
did I ever go to a reform school?

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:14.924
Did you know I knocked off
a hundred men in middle school?

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.261
You mean…

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:21.472
you did kendo?

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.978
You two must be strong!

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.858
Not guilty!

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.993
Sadako is so wicked.

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:47.081
Especially when Yoshida and Yano
have been so nice to her.

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.959
She used them to get to Kazehaya.

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:53.587
And got rid of them
just to get close to him.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:54.922
I know, right?

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.426
She's nothing but trouble
for Yoshida and Yano.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.803
I hope Kazehaya has noticed it too.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.556
Being with Sadako
brings down his popularity.

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.015
-So true.
-Right?

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:05.975
What a waste.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.186
Oh, it's finally lunchtime!

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.938
I'm done! Wow!

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.523
I'm hungry.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.109
Sadako, what's wrong?

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:16.110
Huh?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.778
You look scary.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:24.201
Sorry, but I need to look
for a book in the library.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.786
Eat without me.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.872
Oh, uh, okay.

00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.797
Ugh, I'm so hungry!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.799
Me too. How about grabbing some ramen?

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:39.884
Sounds good.

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:41.510
Hey, join us Sadako.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:43.763
Oh.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.682
I'm sorry, but the exams are coming up.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.602
Are you feeling sick or something?

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.563
I'm fine. Sorry.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.746
Joe! Joe! Joe! I saw it!

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:12.208
Joe, I found it! It was this big!

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.626
Oh, wow!

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:14.835
That's right.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.713
Joe, it's a lot bigger.
Joe, it's a lot bigger.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.770
The rumors about us
are still going around.

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:34.772
Who on earth is spreading those?

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.774
Hey, Kuronuma!

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:41.153
Hey, you know where Yano and Yoshida are?

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.031
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:46.450
Why not? Aren't they your friends?

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.414
No, they're not.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:54.625
Huh?

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:57.044
Sadako…

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.715
Oh, there you are!
I was looking for you two.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.050
Come to the staff room!

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:07.179
Sadako, it's important.
So answer me honestly.

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:08.597
Chizu!

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:14.895
Do you…

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.398
like us?

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:22.444
"Like"? I mean…

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.199
I feel so sorry for them.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.159
Sadako spread the rumors.

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.619
So it was her.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.080
Oh my gosh,
I can't believe she did it.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:35.165
Oh my God, don't tell anyone.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.960
-I knew she would do it.
-How could she betray them?

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.545
How could she do that to them?

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.891
We get it, Sadako.

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.521
What is it, Pin? School chores?

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.065
Let's go, Chizu.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.942
Hey, how can you leave her?

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.445
Huh?
You're the one who told us to come!

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.332
Chizu…

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.793
you really think it was Sadako?

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:24.298
I was 100% sure…

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.509
it wasn't her.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.889
But now…

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.392
I'm having second thoughts.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.104
And I hate myself…

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.149
for that.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.114
2ND-TERM MIDTERM
1ST PERIOD MATH 1

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.157
SIT PER STUDENT NO.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.087
During exams,

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.256
we sit according to our student numbers.

00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:12.680
You may begin.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:19.645
I feel like
the seating arrangement

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.146
was a far away dream.

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.110
It's…

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.697
as if it never happened.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.477
Need some cheering up?

00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:02.563
No, thanks.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.069
It's not like I'm down.

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.740
You always got like this whenever you were

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.450
kicked out from home when we were younger.

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.201
Oh, shut up!

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.124
It's not because of the rumors, is it?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.793
Who cares about the rumors?

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.170
Yeah, I know.

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.760
We aren't friends.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.471
She said so.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.599
Sadako said so.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:41.894
Oh, I see.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:49.485
They say it's Sadako
who's spreading the rumors.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.570
What do you think?

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.739
Try and prove them wrong.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.787
How does she spread rumors?

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:01.497
Huh?

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:04.041
By bad-mouthing you to herself?

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.961
Then the rumor would be
that she talks to herself.

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.089
She doesn't talk all that much
in the first place.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.759
And I don't think she has anyone
to share such a rumor with.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:19.056
Oh, you're right!

00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:20.849
You're right! Totally!

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.018
That's what I thought at first too!

00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:29.191
I'm not saying she's a friend.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.864
Ah! What is up with her?

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.036
Well…

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.414
if it bothers you that much,
why don't you ask her yourself?

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.751
In the worst case scenario,

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:52.089
if she says she doesn't care,
then I'll comfort you.

00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:56.927
No, thanks!

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.062
It's exam week, but you're so late.

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:11.108
I was studying in the library.

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:12.067
See you.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:16.488
Did I…

00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:19.449
Did I do something to make you hate me?

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.036
I don't… I don't get it.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:33.505
And if you don't hate me,
then why do you avoid me?

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.758
Please…

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.469
don't talk to me.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.018
I…

00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.312
I can't do it.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.814
What?

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:56.028
I can't say something
I don't really believe.

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.740
I'm sorry if your popularity goes down.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.367
But I just want to be by your side.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.250
Kuronuma…

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:14.922
I can't understand
unless you're clearer with me.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.635
If I'm around you,

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.179
your popularity will go down.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:23.931
Go down?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.891
Who said that?

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:29.144
It was a rumor.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.187
A rumor?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:39.112
Popularity and rumors
have nothing to do with how I feel.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.034
This is not something for you to decide.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.995
It's for me to decide.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.463
Hmm. So that's why Yoshida
and Yano were so awkward.

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:57.589
Mmm.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:01.385
I know how much you like those two.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:03.553
You do?

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:04.763
Of course I do.

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:08.517
What if…

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.937
What if the situation were flipped?

00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:16.525
What if I, Yano, or Yoshida
kept distance from you?

00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:18.819
I'd hate that.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.029
I want to be together.

00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:23.073
Hmm.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.618
And I'm sure they feel the same.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.997
It makes you anxious

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.041
when people distance themselves
for no good reason.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:37.045
At least that's how it was for me.

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:41.425
I'm sorry.

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:44.886
No more of this.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:48.181
Mmm.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:57.774
Until now, I've been stuck in my own head.

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:03.655
But unless you ask, you'll never know.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:05.949
Mmm.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.077
Unless you speak up, they'll never know.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:16.668
I'll talk with Yoshida and Yano
tomorrow at school.

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:21.548
I'll do my best
so I can be a friend to them.

00:22:23.383 --> 00:22:24.301
Mmm.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.637
Mmm.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:38.190
Ever since things got awkward,
Sadako hasn't smiled even a bit.

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:40.317
Mmm.

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:46.740
Sadako was looking so happy these days.

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:52.579
Huh? What is it?

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.793
I was remembering how Sadako

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:03.048
genuinely laughed
while we were studying together.

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:06.718
Yeah, she did!

00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:10.097
That was such a surprise.

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:18.271
She…

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:22.943
got used to other people avoiding her.

00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:26.655
So it was normal for her.

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:30.200
Mmm.

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:32.786
But she's so sweet.

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:39.876
That's why I could not leave her alone.

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:48.885
She got used to
the way people acted around her.

00:23:52.222 --> 00:23:54.558
She even grew numb to her own feelings.

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.730
It makes you want to cry.

00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:08.071
But I kind of understand how she feels.

00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:11.950
And so…

00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:16.455
…when she genuinely laughed that time…

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:22.043
…it made me so happy.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:33.513
Hey, stop crying!

00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:36.808
But hearing you say that makes me…

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:50.197
Yoshida, Yano…

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.951
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:02.125
Anyway, that rumor about Sadako…

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:05.545
The one that she's used Yoshida
the punk and Yano the whore?

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:08.215
That's the one!
It seems that they recently…

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.300
It's a misunderstanding!

00:25:12.552 --> 00:25:13.428
So…

00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.013
Well…

00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:18.225
It's not true.

00:25:19.976 --> 00:25:23.104
Yoshida and Yano are really kind.

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:25.774
What is she talking about?

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.108
Huh?

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.611
Is she glaring at us?

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.154
Kind?

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.074
That punk and whore?

00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:35.867
I said it's a misunderstanding!

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.203
Shut up!

00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:48.129
You take back what you just said.

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:51.216
Huh? What's that?

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:53.760
What are you saying?

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:58.557
If you say such things,
you'll hurt Yoshida and Yano!

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.766
Take it back!

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.772
Did you hear that just now?

00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:08.608
You're one to talk.

00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:11.319
I can't believe it!

00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:14.114
-Hey, it's Sadako.
-Did something happen?

00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:16.157
Some girls from Class A
got in a fight with Sadako.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.243
Kuronuma? But how?

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:21.538
Sadako is confronting them about
the rumors about Yoshida and Yano.

00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:25.667
What's going on?

00:26:26.293 --> 00:26:27.544
Is someone fighting?

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:30.547
It's Kuronuma.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.508
She's standing up for you two
about those rumors.

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:34.551
Hey!

00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:38.096
Get out of the way! Let us through!

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:44.936
Are you holding back?

00:26:46.646 --> 00:26:47.522
I am.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.483
I can't intervene.

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.945
It's up to Yano and Yoshida now.

00:26:55.822 --> 00:26:56.656
What?

00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:58.533
Me?

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:02.370
You're the one who's been spreading rumors
about Yoshida and Yano, right?

00:27:04.497 --> 00:27:05.624
That's not true!

00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:09.753
Yoshida and Yano
have been very kind to me.

00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:12.047
No one cares!

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:16.051
The reason you even got close to them
was to get close to Kazehaya, right?

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.720
You're such an eyesore.

00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:22.932
Just go away and keep to yourself.

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:25.810
No.

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:33.234
You've got it all wrong!

00:27:34.235 --> 00:27:36.321
You don't understand anything!

00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:38.531
Huh?

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.535
When everyone else

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.789
stayed away from me,

00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:46.790
Yoshida…

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:49.584
and Yano,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.920
they were so kind to me.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:58.635
You have no idea just how much.

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:04.432
It's beyond "like."

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:09.854
Sadako…

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:17.904
Yoshida, she spread those rumors,
and you're still trying to help her?

00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:19.531
It wasn't her!

00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:21.116
There's no way it was her!

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.784
-But--
-We're telling you she didn't.

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:23.993
So that's that!

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.204
Just get out!

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:30.709
If you ever touch Sadako again,
you'll pay for it!

00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:34.796
Huh. I don't get it. Let's go.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.883
Wait!

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:42.512
Take back what you just said.
It really was just a misunderstanding.

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:44.597
Ugh, how annoying!

00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:46.474
Fine! I take it back.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:53.815
Yoshida, Yano,
they understood the rumors weren't true!

00:28:59.154 --> 00:29:01.489
Great.

00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:02.657
They rescued her.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.493
Darn, it didn't work.

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:09.497
Dumb girls.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.460
Sadako, it's fine.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:17.005
We know you'd never say that.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.887
Thank you for believing me.

00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:28.057
I've…

00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:30.810
always…

00:29:32.228 --> 00:29:34.647
wanted to get close to everyone…

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:39.360
but part of me
didn't think it could happen.

00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:43.490
I was afraid…

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:48.620
that there would be weird rumors…

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.956
…that'd hurt you if I'm around you.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.168
But I still…

00:29:57.086 --> 00:29:59.047
didn't want to give you up.

00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:04.677
I know we aren't friends just yet,

00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:07.764
but I…

00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:11.726
I want to be together…

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:14.229
with you…

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.524
so much more.

00:30:21.027 --> 00:30:22.070
Sadako…

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:29.077
you thought that being friends with us
would harm us?

00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:34.791
But still…

00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:37.085
…you wanted to be together with us?

00:30:48.429 --> 00:30:49.597
Silly.

00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:52.851
You're so silly.

00:30:57.021 --> 00:31:00.233
I'm ashamed of myself
for doubting you.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.028
Sadako…

00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:07.532
don't ever get used to being alone again.

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.077
Sadako…

00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:14.163
we were friends…

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.166
…even before we knew it!

00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:20.003
Huh?

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:25.300
We've been friends…

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.553
all along.

00:31:35.602 --> 00:31:38.855
Okay, group hug!

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:46.029
-They're coming out.
-They're coming out.

00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.157
Yano, your eyes are all red.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.492
They're so swollen.

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:54.412
Kazehaya.

00:31:56.122 --> 00:31:57.165
Good for you!

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:01.836
Thank you, Kazehaya!
