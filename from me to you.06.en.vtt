WEBVTT

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.015
So, Sawako, how do you like
the new seating arrangement?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.433
Mmm.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.934
It may be my imagination,

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.145
but I feel like people
aren't avoiding me anymore.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:21.438
-Mmm.
-Mmm, that's great!

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.314
Thanks to you guys.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.904
We sit further apart now,
but they still treat me the same.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:31.531
But…

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.324
What? It's almost gone.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.953
…I feel close to but distant from Kazehaya

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.788
all at the same time.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.124
TO CHIZU
TO AYANE

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.210
TO KAZEHAYA

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.427
Okay.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.348
February.
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:07.859
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.755
Oh!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.090
Morning.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.966
Morning.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.054
I'll get going.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.055
Oh, okay.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.898
Here you go.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.651
-Homemade? Can I try it now?
-Wow.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.820
Sure. Enjoy it with Sanada.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.947
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:57.534
Huh?

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.244
There's none for you.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.620
-Go away.
-Here.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:01.704
Seriously?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.872
Thanks!

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.875
-Sawako gave me chocolate!
-Why'd you give some to him?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.585
You're way too kind.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.630
Kazehaya,
how many chocolates did you get?

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:11.548
One.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.424
-I'm gonna try it.
-How nice.

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.844
-Already?
-Oh, you're not?

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.137
I'm saving it for later.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.849
Oh, hey. Kazehaya,
this is for you.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.433
-Thank you!
-I made a lot, so…

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.186
Thank you. Did you bake this?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.231
-It's my new recipe.
-Those obligatory chocolates.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.108
Oh, sorry.

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:32.026
Oh.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.319
I'll go to the bathroom.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.738
I didn't have enough.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.574
-Thanks.
-Yeah, thank you.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.119
I'm too nervous.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:42.996
Ugh!

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:46.040
I can't help but become too conscious.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.841
Ryu, that looks good.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:55.967
Homemade?

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.511
-Want some?
-Mmm.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.054
Was it from Yoshida?

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.473
Yeah, Kuronuma made it.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.726
Chizu shared hers with me.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.439
Kuronuma gave me chocolate!

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:12.984
She seems to be fine
with the new seating arrangement.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:14.861
You're dismissed!

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.826
Kazehaya,
can you come for a second?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.877
I did my best to make these.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.880
I was hoping to give it to you.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.057
It seems like Kazehaya
refused the chocolate.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.642
Yeah, I wonder why.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.559
No idea.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.604
Refused?

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.273
I never thought about that

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.984
because it wasn't obligatory.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.416
Kazehaya.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.669
Hey, Kazehaya.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.546
It's Valentine's Day,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.924
so this is for you.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.054
What's the big deal?

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.348
This is my first and last.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.519
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.939
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.914
Were you peeking?

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.667
You're horrible.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.876
I'm sorry.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.920
I got really anxious and…

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.800
Kazehaya doesn't take chocolate
from people who have a crush him.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:03.011
What? Then how about yours?

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.512
I'm an exception.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.806
He's already rejected me.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.602
Is that for Kazehaya?

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.356
It's just to show my gratitude.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:20.236
You said you weren't thinking
of dating him, but were you serious?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.947
Is this really a thank-you?

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.911
Don't you have
some ulterior motive somewhere?

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:35.168
Well, he will take it if it's obligatory.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.712
Don't regret it, though.

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.796
Bye.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.349
It's not obligatory.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.812
I couldn't give the chocolate to him
as I had an ulterior motive behind them.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.573
It's April.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.408
The new semester has started.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.660
It's my second year,

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:15.917
and I'm in the same class
as Yoshida, Yano, and Kazehaya.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.551
I'm Kento Miura. Nice to meet you!

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.805
Oh, I'm Kuronuma.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.434
What? So you do have eyebrows!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.940
Stop that! Girls shouldn't frown.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.901
Smile like this.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:43.569
Smile.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.114
Oh.

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:48.825
Man, he's quite a character.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.326
A new breed.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.536
Glad to meet you!

00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:01.462
Kuronuma,
are you done with the planting?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:02.422
Yes.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.264
You still here?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.057
Oh, yeah.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.731
I see.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:22.567
What?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.529
Kazehaya, are you not seeing anyone?

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.781
Huh? Where is this coming from?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.325
Because you're popular.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.245
Oh.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.249
You have someone in mind,
don't you?

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.334
Have you never heard of restraint?

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:42.670
Who is it?

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.923
I can help if it's someone I know.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.637
Yano, that's not very becoming of you.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.017
I don't need your help.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:08:00.813
The person I like should be
the first person to hear it from me.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.941
So I can't tell you.

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.155
Hmm. Okay.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.757
Did you plant a lot?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.593
Mmm.

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:35.348
It's been a while
since it was just the two of us.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.641
What do I do?

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.355
I'm glad we're in the same class.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:45.691
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:50.238
Although our seats are far apart
so we don't get to talk much,

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.616
we'll be in the same class
until we graduate.

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.620
Mmm.

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:02.124
Were you waiting for someone?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.463
Kuronuma, you.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:09.590
Huh?

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.259
I…

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:17.640
I thought I was your closest guy friend.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.560
But was I

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.271
flattering myself?

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.114
Well…

00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:37.535
I…

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.375
I'm sorry.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.961
I… I didn't mean to trouble you.

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:48.879
Bye.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.684
Hey.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.024
Huh?

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.027
Oh.

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.155
That's an unexpected pair.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.246
Why couldn't I answer him?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.462
Did I come across as rude
for being so self-conscious?

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:44.769
-Oh, Yoshida, Kuronuma, morning!
-Morning.

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:46.354
Oh, morning.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.569
Mr. Pleasant is a ladykiller.

00:10:56.697 --> 00:10:58.115
Morning, Sadako.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.826
Hmm, morning.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.829
You're way too serious!

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:05.665
Way too serious.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.250
Morning! You.

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.836
M… Morning.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.172
Morning!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.175
M… Morning!

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:18.427
Morning.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:20.262
Morning.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:23.766
Morning.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.394
RAMEN
TETSURYUKEN

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.188
You look down these days.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:31.607
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.320
I shouldn't have said that to her

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:40.032
while she's trying
to get used to a new class.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.202
You think I'm bothering her?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.747
-Who?
-Kuronuma.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.166
What did you say to her?

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.334
Don't ask.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.211
-That's selfish.
-That's right.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:57.925
I'm selfish, self-centered,
and possessive.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.346
So I can't hold back anymore.

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:07.935
Even if it might trouble her,
I… I just want to tell her right now.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:14.066
I mean, maybe she likes you too.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.278
I don't think she hates me. It's…

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:23.451
more like respect or admiration
for being pleasant.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.205
She didn't even give me any chocolate.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.082
Huh? What?

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.086
Ugh, I'm totally confused!

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.922
Do you feel impatient?

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.048
Yes!

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:41.635
I keep thinking someone else
could fall for her.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.014
It makes me uneasy.

00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.273
Well, I want some popcorn.

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:55.232
What?

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.027
-Just popcorn?
-Hey, girls!

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:00.404
Kento.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.075
Since we're classmates,
why don't we hang out?

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:09.872
You can ask for my advice anytime.

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:18.589
Girls like me.
They'll say, "Kento is such a nice guy."

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:21.759
But I'm a philanthropist.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.094
My girlfriend doesn't get it.

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:30.100
I'm seriously just wishing
for happiness for all girls.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.230
I'm always thinking of…

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:36.565
…how to make them happy.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.485
You're the one who needs advice.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:43.531
Sadako, don't forget to smile.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:46.033
Master, I'm sorry.

00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:48.202
You call him "Master"?

00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:51.622
Because I'm her master of happiness. Hmm?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.791
How about this?

00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:55.543
Smile whenever I do this.

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:58.921
What the heck is that?
Am I hallucinating?

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:05.678
No, you're still way too stiff.

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:09.181
Don't force her to smile.
It'll make her look scary.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.683
Mmm.

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:12.309
All right.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:16.355
But you have such a great role model
of a cute girl in Yano.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:18.607
Right, Ayane?

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.693
Thanks, but stay away.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.904
And you have beautiful legs, Yoshida.

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:25.781
Huh?

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:28.200
Oh, that's right!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.828
Can you do a study session
for the upcoming exams?

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:31.745
Huh?

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.082
I heard that the one you did last year
turned out great.

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:40.087
It'll be a good chance
to get to know everyone.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.672
Well, that…

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:45.593
It's decided!

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.303
Don't decide things on your own.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.263
Why not? Right?

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:51.682
Mmm.

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.934
I'll do it.

00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:56.812
-What? Are you sure about this?
-She said she'll do it.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.070
Looking at this formula,

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.616
the denominator is the sum
of the ratio of M and N.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:12.494
N then attaches to A, and M attaches to B.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.497
You'll want to remember this formula.

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.002
Let me give you an example.

00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:28.844
Applying the formula I explained,
the denominator is one fifth, and…

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.846
Ah. Then how about this one?

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.265
This one is…

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.893
-The answer is eight-thirds!
-The answer is eight-thirds!

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:37.102
Mmm, correct.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.729
Yay! I got it!

00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:43.484
The key is that it becomes a fraction
when a negative number is squared.

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.693
Wow.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.654
-Let's go home.
-Thank you.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.322
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.201
-Sawako, let's go.
-Oh, mmm.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.455
Well, great job, Sadako.

00:15:57.831 --> 00:15:58.791
Thank you.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.085
I was able to do this

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:04.588
because Kazehaya had told me
that I could be of use to others.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.803
Kuronuma, can I talk to you?

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:13.430
Oh. Mmm.

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.266
Bye.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.478
We'll wait outside.

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:21.230
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.989
Thank you for today.

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.868
I'm not really good
at speaking in public, but…

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:36.745
You are.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.497
What?

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.000
You're good at teaching.

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:44.670
Thank you.

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:48.841
I just…

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.886
I wanted to tell you not to worry
about what I said the other day.

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:54.930
Just forget it.

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:56.473
Huh?

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.865
Sawako, are you okay?

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.421
Hey.

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:29.757
I was waiting for you.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.556
Why do we need to come here?

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.311
I wanted to talk with Mr. Popular.

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:46.315
You might just be more popular than me.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.776
Hey, I'm just kidding!

00:17:56.075 --> 00:18:00.370
Sadako's always been out of place
since her first year, right?

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:02.873
What?

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.793
I hear you can't stand
to see someone not fitting in,

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.920
but maybe it's better
just to let things be.

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.174
What do you mean?

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:15.886
She's out of place?
I can't stand people being left out?

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.137
It's not like that.

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:21.850
Don't get upset.
You're making things awkward.

00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:25.646
Hey, let's see
that pleasant smile of yours!

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:28.273
It's none of your business anyway, Miura.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.777
Don't meddle with her too much.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.071
She's finally fitting in well
with the class.

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.406
Do you want her to be left out
because of how you treat her

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.117
and others get jealous of her?

00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.245
Why do I need to hear that from you?

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.874
And even if that happened,
I'd deal with it.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.378
Calm down.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:52.464
I'm not trying
to fight you for her.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.388
But just make sure
you don't give her any false hope.

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.393
What false hope are you talking about?

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.603
And what do you know?

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:11.316
What I'm saying is that you don't get it.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:15.571
You and Sadako are completely different.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:17.865
Different?

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.534
She's trying her best,

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.870
so don't make it hard for her.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.121
I know that!

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.418
Kazehaya, is there someone you like?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.961
There is!

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:33.714
Then why don't you just date her?
Do you need my help?

00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:36.884
No! Never!

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:43.599
I see.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.517
Kazehaya said that?

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.562
He became impatient.

00:19:49.062 --> 00:19:49.938
Huh?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.736
First of all, why didn't you give him
the chocolate on Valentine's Day?

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.865
You even visited the shrine together
with him for New Year's.

00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:02.034
Why didn't you just give it to him?

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.705
Didn't you exchange
your phone numbers too?

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:12.586
I couldn't give him the chocolate
as a sign of gratitude.

00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:17.341
And I can't bring myself to contact him.

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:24.014
I don't know what to do.

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:28.477
I'm so self-conscious that I can't…

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.482
even greet him properly.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.320
I… I'm scared.

00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:41.990
You like him.

00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:49.414
But are you going to let
your fear keep you like this?

00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:53.877
If you want things to change,
you have to do something about it.

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:00.425
-Morning.
-Hey.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.886
-Who's taller? Who's taller?
-Who?

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.265
Hey, stop that.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.559
Is Andy taller?

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.228
Again?

00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:13.105
-Who's taller?
-It's so close.

00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:15.899
Seriously? I'll beat you next year.

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:17.234
Ah! Ouch!

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:18.986
What's your problem?

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:22.698
Stop avoiding Sawako like yesterday.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.116
Huh? I… I wasn't.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.785
Then don't keep acting like that.

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:28.662
She's too used to being avoided.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.914
Don't mislead her like that.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.088
Wait up, Yano.

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.968
Everyone just says whatever they want.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:47.889
-What just happened?
-I have no idea. Do you?

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.100
-You know, don't you?
-What?

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:53.812
But Kazehaya
is in a tough position too.

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:57.566
When the girl he likes
is frightened by him.

00:21:58.191 --> 00:21:59.026
Huh?

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:01.945
The girl he likes is Sawako?!

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.532
You're too loud!

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.660
-Then what's the problem?
-There never was!

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.704
Then let's tell them both!

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.957
-You think that's gonna solve everything?
-What?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.461
If she continues to be scared
of being around him,

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:19.546
then they'd just be dating on the surface.

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.631
And that won't change anything.

00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:24.301
Mmm, right.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.263
For me,

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:33.769
I don't want Sawako to be in
a relationship where she feels inferior.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.691
It's no good when a couple
isn't on equal footing.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.111
Mmm.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.572
Well, besides,

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:51.161
Sawako probably wouldn't even believe
that Kazehaya likes her.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.708
She has to make her own path.

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:09.554
-Kazehaya.
-Hey, Kazehaya!

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.224
-Oh, hey.
-Come on!

00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:15.143
Let's go to the gym.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.979
-Hmm, to play basketball?
-Everyone's waiting there.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.275
I wanted to talk to him.

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.780
But no words came out.

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:30.450
Is it my imagination?

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.036
I feel a distance.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:39.126
Kuronuma, are you okay with this?

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.044
You really don't have to
if you don't want to.

00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:45.298
Oh, I'd be happy to do it
if everyone is happy with that.

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:46.675
Good.

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.012
Good for you.

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:11.825
Sadako.

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:13.618
Can we talk?

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.203
It's okay?

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.918
I'm glad they're excited about you
for the school festival.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:25.130
You totally fit in now.

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:29.009
Do I really?

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.344
You can't tell?

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.555
You really do!

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.976
You don't need Kazehaya's help anymore.

00:24:39.102 --> 00:24:39.936
Huh?

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:42.481
Aren't you happy?

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:48.695
Or did you want him
to care for you as a lone wolf?

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:51.907
Oh, mm-mm.

00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:53.283
Right?

00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.953
But it's understandable
if you misunderstood

00:24:57.037 --> 00:24:59.623
because of the way he kept caring for you.

00:24:59.706 --> 00:25:00.540
Huh?

00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:01.750
Uh, what?

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:02.792
I don't.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:07.631
He didn't have any bad intentions,
but he's a bit insensitive.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:10.217
He isn't!

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:17.599
He treats everyone equally
and is bright and kind.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:23.021
That's why he's the first person
I didn't feel a barrier with.

00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:25.482
Wow.

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.192
I just

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.487
had the wrong idea.

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:35.408
So you knew it was a misunderstanding?

00:25:40.455 --> 00:25:41.790
I see.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:47.796
But shouldn't you keep away from him?

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:49.798
Huh?

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.883
It's the best for the both of you.

00:25:52.926 --> 00:25:58.014
You can enjoy your life on your own,
and he'll be freed from his duty.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.768
Sadako.

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:05.605
There is someone Kazehaya likes.

00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:08.650
Huh?

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:11.778
I wasn't gonna say this,

00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:16.866
but don't let him sway you like that.

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:22.664
You wouldn't want
to trouble him, would you?

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.298
Sadako?

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.887
Were you that serious about him?

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:40.932
Sorry!
I… I didn't mean to make you cry.

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:44.894
Yeah. You'll find someone better for you.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.233
Don't worry!

00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:52.694
Your smile is so pretty.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.571
You need to be more confident!

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:57.157
There are tons of men out there!

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:04.539
I mean,

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:06.916
how about me?

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:10.295
Huh?

00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:12.380
I'm open to it…

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:14.633
Sadako.

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:18.094
What are you doing?

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.222
And why is she crying?

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:24.267
What's your problem?
I didn't make her cry.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.772
No, it's not Master's fault.

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:31.441
He was just encouraging me.

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:33.234
What?

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:35.528
Then why?

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:43.495
Wait, are we interrupting a love triangle?

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:45.955
-Are they fighting over Sadako?
-Oh!

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:48.541
She's so popular!

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:49.834
Yeah, we are.

00:27:51.544 --> 00:27:52.545
Huh?

00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:55.507
So… So you mean you like Sadako?

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.633
I do.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.551
Seriously?

00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:01.763
I like Kuronuma.

00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:04.349
What's wrong with that?

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:06.810
Nothing, but…

00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:12.357
They'll misunderstand.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:16.820
They'll misunderstand
if you say it like that.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.409
Is she saying we'll misunderstand
that it is really something?

00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.202
She's way too self-conscious.

00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:26.246
What's so funny?

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.001
Kuronuma.

00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:38.633
Just say if I'm a burden to you.

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:52.647
Kazehaya!

00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:55.859
What?

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.336
Why are you crying?

00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:17.922
Is it because of Miura?

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:25.764
Master just cares for me.

00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.436
Then is it because of me?

00:29:35.023 --> 00:29:36.024
I'm sorry.

00:29:37.525 --> 00:29:40.236
I'm… I'm sorry to worry you.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.739
I'm sorry to burden you.

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.119
"Worry"?

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.541
You think Miura "cares" for you?

00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:59.756
But with me,
you think of yourself as a "burden"?

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.809
It's because I care for you.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.437
I…

00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:18.525
I'm not the man you think I am.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.198
I wasn't trying to be pleasant
or treat everyone equally.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.911
I've never treated you like the others.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.587
I…

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:42.757
I like you.

00:30:48.888 --> 00:30:49.889
Do you…

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:52.892
Do you like me?

00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:02.694
But…

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:07.907
my "like" and your "like"…

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:11.995
are different.

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.080
Right?
