PAST EXAM QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.738
Why are you talking
as if I've decided?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.906
Because you actually have--

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.074
I haven't.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.328
It would separate all of us.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.041
I want us all to be together.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:44.961
Every one of us.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.132
Which includes you, of course.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.426
Kuronuma.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:54.929
I'm sorry.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.641
Let me think about it.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.102
About college.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.074
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.076
It's been so long!

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.245
I really missed you guys!

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.874
How have you been? How have you been?
Oh, you've been studying, right?

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.793
Did you forget about me?

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.044
No, of course not.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.423
Oh, since it's been a while,
I brought the rice crackers you love.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:35.553
Sawako! Thank you!

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:36.971
I might have forgotten a bit.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.228
Just kidding.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.313
Ugh! Come on, Yano!

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.273
You're seriously hot and cold.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.112
How about you, Chizu?
Are you just working as usual?

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.364
Mmm, almost every day.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.783
Ryu is practicing for college baseball.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.619
Aren't you sad being away from him?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.830
It's weird.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.666
I hated to be away from him,

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.961
but I felt calmer
once I decided to be his "home."

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.880
It's only four years.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.049
You two are so strongly connected.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.635
I guess so.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.472
I love this.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.182
Huh?

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.476
Seeing you two puts me at ease.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.814
I'm glad I took a break
from my studies to see you two.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.024
Were you anxious?

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.819
Mmm.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.572
I was kind of feeling panicky.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.033
I'm glad you came.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.577
Huh?

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.663
You tend to shut yourself off.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:51.171
I was just recalling Pin's stupid face,
and I thought I needed a little break.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.508
Why are you remembering him?
I'm glad I don't have to see him.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.761
It's not like I think about him a lot.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.431
It annoys me just to think of him.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.767
He acts like a child
even though he's a grown-up.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.482
Who does he think he is?

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.904
You get so lively
when you talk about him, Yano.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.989
That's not true!

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.159
But he's a good teacher.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.704
You really think so?
I don't get it.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.425
Every one of us.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.179
Which includes you, of course.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:51.856
Oh.

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:57.987
Mom, are you okay?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.364
Yes.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.282
Sit down.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.992
Okay.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.918
I'm just tired.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:23.805
Why are you slacking?
Didn't you say you'd study like hell?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.266
I'm not, but it's… it's just…

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.185
You're worried about Mom?
No need. She has me.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.646
Just think of what's most important
to you at this moment.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.697
Are you…

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.657
Are you okay, honey?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.367
I am.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.666
SAPPORO UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION
2015 GUIDEBOOK

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.725
Hello, Kazehaya?

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.643
Kuronuma?

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:13.354
Sorry to call you suddenly.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.317
I wanted to talk to you again
about colleges.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.278
Me too.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.115
Bro, aren't you done yet?

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.575
Just a sec.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.703
I'm sorry, but I'm cooking for my brother.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.081
You're doing the cooking today?

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:36.586
No. Actually, Mom had to be hospitalized.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.670
What?

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.050
If you don't mind my leftovers.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.219
Thank you.
Especially when you're so busy studying.

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:49.057
Wow! This looks so much better
than what you made.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:51.934
Is your mom okay?

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.645
Mmm, it happens sometimes.

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.731
I think she's just tired.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.905
-Oh, Sawako.
-Good evening.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.115
She brought over some food for us.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.076
What?

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.204
Did you make her bring all of this food
so that you could be lazy?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.417
Oh no, I'm sorry
that they're only my leftovers.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:28.096
Thank you. It was delicious!

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.932
Sawako, I'm sorry for troubling you.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.725
No problem.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.860
May I do the dishes?

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.154
Uh, let me help you.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:50.159
Shota, you're going to help me
with cleaning up the store.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:00.837
Are you…

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:04.173
still thinking of taking over my business?

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:07.051
Yes, I am.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.970
That's why I'm doing this.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:15.685
Yes, but all you can do
is make burned fried rice, am I wrong?

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.815
Even today, you relied
on Sawako, after all.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.404
I don't intend to retire just yet.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:27.989
I work alone!

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.671
I'm done with the dishes, so I'll go home.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:45.840
Mmm.

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:50.094
I'm sorry that we couldn't
really talk about colleges.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.513
Mm-mm.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.390
Is your father okay?

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.436
Mmm. He seems to like you.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.273
But he's being harsh on me again.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:10.490
You're his child, and you're a boy,
so he's strict with you.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.118
But I hope he'll understand.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.163
Hmm.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.875
TOKIE KAZEHAYA

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.045
I'm Sawako Kuronuma. This is for you.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.381
Thank you!

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.595
How beautiful.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.724
So this is what it's like
to have a daughter.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:39.894
Mom, I'll put them here.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.604
Thanks.

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:46.817
Hey, Sawako, I heard you came
to our house yesterday.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:48.986
Yes, I hope I wasn't intruding.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.864
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.032
Did Dad tell you?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.825
Mmm.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.703
Shota, tell me…

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.790
how you're feeling about Dad.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:02.833
How I'm feeling?

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.628
He's stubborn

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.339
and disapproves of me.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.052
I still don't know how to please him.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.097
You're stubborn, just like him.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:18.307
Me?

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.478
He's always been easily misunderstood.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.065
When you were born,

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:30.319
I thought he'd name you
with the same "Sho"

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.029
from his Shoichiro.

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:36.701
But he didn't.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.620
When he saw you after you were born…

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.791
…what he desired for you wasn't victory

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.085
nor to lead others.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.380
But to strive.

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.299
SHOTA

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.930
Since then,
he would tell me everything you did.

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:01.350
Honey! Shota is standing!

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:02.977
Oh yes, yes!

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.604
Woah!

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:05.980
Okay!

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.065
He's clumsy.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.236
You may not have noticed,

00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:18.618
but you've made him happy this whole time.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.286
What?

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.165
When you get home,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.002
check the second drawer
on the right of the dresser.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.926
SHOTA - THIRD GRADE
FATHER'S DAY

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.804
SHOULDER MASSAGE COUPONS FOR DAD
15 MINUTES EACH

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.225
Dad! It's Father's Day!

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:44.685
Here!

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.484
Focus on your studies.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:52.526
Dismissed!

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:00.159
SHOULDER MASSAGE COUPONS FOR DAD
15 MINUTES EACH

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.341
What are you doing?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.051
Dad.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.473
I really want to take over your business.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.226
I also want to be a sports trainer.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.148
Please listen to me.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.484
You and I both have the bad habit
of assuming things

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:35.236
without listening to others.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.325
I have a reason
for wanting to be a sports trainer.

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.494
Pin, he told me.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.329
SPORTS TRAINER COURSE

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.456
A trainer makes a training plan,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.502
gives massages,
and thinks about how to prevent injuries.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.130
Your dad
is quite knowledgeable about this.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:59.301
It's hard to find someone like him
in such a rural area.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.642
This… This is what I want to do.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.397
I followed my heart
only to find your steps.

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:15.609
Seeing you made me want to do it.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.364
I'm not just thinking
of taking over the store.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:21.991
I want to…

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.951
I want to create a new type of store

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:27.163
that provides sports training
for high schoolers.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:38.382
Taking care of Mom, taking over the store,
and studying to be a trainer

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.218
are all the things I want to do.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.722
You may think
I depend on others, but if so…

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.812
then please let me depend on you.

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:55.733
Let me… Let me go to college.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.003
SHOULDER MASSAGE COUPONS FOR DAD
15 MINUTES EACH

00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.463
Has this expired?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.176
Huh?

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.515
It's not easy to be a sports trainer.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:30.559
If it is suitable, I'll be the judge.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.777
Not strong enough.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.988
You're too stiff! My fingers can't dig in.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.534
Oh, there it is!

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.661
-That's right. Good.
-Right there.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.956
Good.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.209
-Does it hurt?
-Good!

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.003
I got my dad's approval.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.924
I was finally able to tell him
how I've admired him.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:04.468
Thanks to you.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.304
Me?

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:12.768
I'll move towards my dream
one step at a time.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.147
Mmm. Press on.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:18.941
You too.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.985
Bye.

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:22.820
Mmm, bye.

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:03.193
CAREER PATH SURVEY

00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:17.499
Kazehaya…

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.336
about college…

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.547
Hmm?

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:26.467
I was

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.137
planning to go to the same college as you.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.432
But…

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:38.646
seeing everyone making an effort
to achieve their dreams…

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:45.277
helped me face my own dream
of becoming a teacher

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:49.657
who understands
the hearts of her students.

00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:56.163
Kazehaya…

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:02.586
I'm applying to
the Sapporo University of Education.

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.006
Mmm.

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.051
We're together,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.097
so we'll be okay wherever we'll be.

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:20.896
It'll be all right.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.314
Press on.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:26.777

Mmm, you've been making progress.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.578
You'll just need one more push.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.748
Or maybe two more.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.333
Or maybe three more.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:42.876
Three more?

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.088
Don't get too relaxed
just because I complimented you.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.090
You're actually a good teacher.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.926
Ah, who are you to say that?

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.733
Okay, just a bit more. Keep it up.

00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:11.613
What? What is it?

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:14.825
Mmm. You're a good teacher.
I guarantee it.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:18.746
Just who do you think you are?

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.762
Yano,
you've been acting weird lately.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.889
What?

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:40.184
I sometimes think
you have a fever or something.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.603
Be careful not to catch
a cold in this weather.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:43.604
Thanks.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.648
It's not a cold, so I'm fine.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.109
Let me know
if you're struggling with something.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.945
-I'm not!
-Are you sure?

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:53.739
-Mmm.
-I feel something is off.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.324
Mr. Arai?

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.120
Huh? What are you talking about, Sawako?

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:05.334
Do you like Mr. Arai, Ayane?

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.053
No.

00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:17.137
What is this?

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.390
Huh? Are you serious? Is it Pin?

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.768
I'm sorry, Ayane. Sorry.

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.108
How did you know?

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:31.944
Yano.

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:33.821
No way.

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.076
Pin…

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:43.705
…seriously and genuinely thinks
what's best for me.

00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:47.960
And he genuinely scolded me
when I needed it.

00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:53.674
He's the first one to ever do that.

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:57.386
What… What will you do?

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.140
I won't do anything. I can't do anything.

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:03.350
I… I guess so.

00:19:05.602 --> 00:19:06.812
Don't tell anyone.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.859
I meant to just graduate
and forget all this.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:26.623
Aren't you a bit off?

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.125
No, I'm not!

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:33.172
Oh, by the way, Toru is coming home
on New Year's Day, isn't he?

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.049
He is, but…

00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:40.637
Uh, don't get me wrong. It's just that
we haven't told him about us yet.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.934
I know.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:58.071

I'm so happy! Thanks!

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:00.908
-Sure.
-Why are you so cold?

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:03.577
-Are you sure? Later?
-Yes.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.959
Yano! Going home from school?

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.170
What are you doing here?

00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:16.840
I'm having a group blind date
with career women.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:18.383
Huh? Again?

00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.101
I smell a woman.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.857
It could be me.
I used a perfume sample just now.

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:38.445
Oh man! It is you!

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.697
Why are you using perfume?

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.532
I just wanted a sweet fragrance

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.494
to motivate me to study
and sleep peacefully.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.372
Huh? Fragrance?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.209
Stupid.

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:56.046
-You're stupid.
-It really works.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.465
It won't.

00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.092
You're so rude!

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.426
Anyway, I'm cold.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:04.763
Okay. Let's get something warm to drink.

00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:06.807
-Then I want milk tea.
-Ah!

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.435
Sorry, but I only have a 10,000-yen bill.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:11.478
What?

00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.313
Ah, there's always next time.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:16.233
Then buy me some when I pass.

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.235
Milk tea?

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.947
Anything as a reward.

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.075
It can even be an eraser or something.

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:27.077
I'll think about it.

00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:28.745
I'll walk you home.

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.248
What about the blind date?

00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:33.458
Was it a lie?

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.712
Thanks to you,
I don't feel like going anymore.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.139
What does that even mean?

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:35.187

AYANE YANO

00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:08.804
What will he say

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.432
when I tell him that I passed?

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:13.892
Long time no see.

00:23:14.434 --> 00:23:17.270
All that's left
is the graduation ceremony.

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.648
-You're right. I'm sad.
-Yeah, me too.

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.781
-Thank you very much.
-Bye.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:43.338
Mmm.

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.436
Hey, Yano!

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.729
Congratulations! It's amazing!

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:01.648
Thanks.

00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:05.902
What's wrong, Yano?

00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:09.531
Oh, are you feeling sad
about going to Tokyo?

00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:11.950
Chizu.

00:24:14.744 --> 00:24:16.163
I need your strength.

00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:19.666
Huh? Strength?

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:23.920
Just give me energy like you always do.

00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:25.881
Like I always do?

00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:32.929
Stupid! Stupid! You're stupid, Yano!

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:40.353
Hello?

00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:43.064
Hey, Sawako.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:44.900
Ayane!

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:48.778
I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:50.780
Thanks.

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:52.824
Was Mr. Arai happy for you?

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.291
I haven't seen him yet.

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:05.337
This might be my last time…

00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.841
that I'll be able to talk to him.

00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:19.643
If I see him…

00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:24.231
…I'll cry.

00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:27.192
And then he'll know.

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:35.659
But I want to see him.

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:37.994
Tell me to cheer up.

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.290
Mmm.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:47.837
Cheer up, Ayane! Cheer up!

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:51.383
Cheer up!

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:06.022
Oh!

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.865
It's about the results, right?

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.919
Ah, don't worry.
You're still young.

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:30.755
You have a bright future, okay?

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.507
So I mean…

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.427
You still have a chance!

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.511
Look forward!

00:26:37.887 --> 00:26:41.725
Just failing once or even twice
is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:26:42.225 --> 00:26:43.768
You tried hard, okay?

00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.228
I passed.

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:47.814
My first choice…

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.650
I passed.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.279
Huh?

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.990
Oh man…

00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:00.410
Why were you so late?
How long do you think I waited?

00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:01.536
You waited for me?

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:03.788
I didn't.

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:14.007
Fine.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.260
I admit it.
I waited for you all day today.

00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.182
I see.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.309
You passed.

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.731
Yano.

00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:32.484
You did it.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.655
Mm-hmm.

00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:39.949
You made me worry.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.035
I should've known better.

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:49.250
What's wrong?

00:27:55.256 --> 00:27:56.132
You know…

00:27:58.551 --> 00:27:59.469
Pin.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.520
Actually, I…

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.730
You better not say it.

00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:21.658
No.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:24.994
I will.

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:28.456
I want to move on.

00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:35.171
I like you.

00:28:40.468 --> 00:28:41.720
You're my first love.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.932
I came to love someone for the first time.

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:02.407
Silly!

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:05.577
You're ten years too young.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.747
You're not in my range. Sorry.

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.922
I guess it's a "no."

00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:24.179
Hey, time to go home.

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:32.979
Yano?

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:42.947
It's a gift for passing the exam.

00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:44.115
Great job.

00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:53.458
For the past year,

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:56.586
you worked hard, going beyond your limits.

00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.256
Not just in academics,
but also your mindset.

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:02.467
So…

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:05.929
even if you fail at something
in the future,

00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:08.973
you'll be okay.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.769
That's because…

00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.312
…I believe in you.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.946
Yano.

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.406
Well done on passing.

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:30.161
Thank you…

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:33.498
Mr. Arai.

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:37.126
Sure.

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:07.907
KITAHORO GAKUIN UNIVERSITY
LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.452
Don't get too proud.

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:13.913
What matters most

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:17.667
is how you live your life from now on
while you're on your own.

00:31:20.336 --> 00:31:21.212
I know.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.219
-Thanks.
-Bye.

00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:29.679

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:33.892
Work hard.

Kazehaya, congratulations!

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:40.440
Oh, you came.

00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:41.524
Mmm.

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.110
I couldn't help it
when I saw your message.

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:47.947
Thank you.

00:31:48.031 --> 00:31:49.991
Sure. Congrats.

00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.748

00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:00.960
Mmm. I'll try my best.
