WEBVTT

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.968
The phrase "I live in America"

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.389
and the phrase
"study English" are combined.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.810
So I used a plus sign to show that.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.896
"I lived in America."

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.362
I…

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.322
I like you.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:37.245
But my "like" and your "like"…

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.207
are different.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.218
Sawako!

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.429
We've been looking for you!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.057
I'm sorry.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.309
What happened that made you skip class?

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.854
Kazehaya…

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.482
turned me down.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.317
What?

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.278
I…

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.617
I think I got overconfident.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.958
I'm embarrassed
that I selfishly fell in love.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.212
He was just…

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.633
being kind because he felt bad.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.386
What makes you think like that?

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.848
I don't like this, Sawako.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:40.809
Wait, Chizu.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.980
Do you think we're being friends with you
because we feel bad for you?

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.273
I… I don't.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.318
I'm saying if you did,
it would make me angry.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:55.198
Kazehaya isn't feeling bad for you either.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.494
You're the one who made him act like that.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.624
You have us.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.171
So stop looking down on yourself.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.466
It makes me sick.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.761
Stop being so clueless!

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.830
Chizu gets angry
when she's frustrated or sad.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.791
But she cares for you.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.677
You know, Sawako…

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.558
at first, we… we thought you were…

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.227
…gloomy…

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.439
…and out of place.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.818
But because of the efforts you made,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.863
we learned who you are

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.366
and how amazing you are.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.329
We like you so much.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.878
It's because you took
the courage to show it to us.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.841
You, us, and Kazehaya…

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:40.637
we're all the same.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.599
Unless you make the barrier.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:59.030
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.501
Shota.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.722
She turned me down.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.689
She doesn't want others
to think we're something.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.361
I…

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.576
I confessed my love to her,
but it didn't work.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:55.920
I see.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.177
That girl…

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.562
Kurumi.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.149
You look awful.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.821
Kazehaya,

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:24.907
he turned me down.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.286
Excuse me?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.789
Please don't tell me
you think we're on the same boat.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.083
We aren't.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.173
I don't see you as a rival.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.258
Huh?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.265
-Because I was turned down?
-Because you didn't fight for it!

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.477
It's because you hurt him.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:53.811
Hurt?

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:55.813
Me?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:02.236
I kept bothering him
even though he likes someone else.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.404
Thickheaded!

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:05.698
Are you stupid?

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.451
Don't you know him?

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:13.748
Wasn't he…

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.585
the only one who didn't pity you?

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.256
Even when Chizu and Ayane pitied you?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.637
Don't think we're the same.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:30.973
I told him straight up.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.143
I told him I loved him.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.939
I told him clearly.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.691
We aren't the same!

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:58.376
Hey, Shota!

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.380
-You're more of a jerk than I thought.
-Huh?

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.590
Oh, come on. I heard all about it.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.008
You turned her down, right?

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.177
-Kuronuma?
-She turned me down.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.055
Oh, what are you trying to be?
A gigolo or a nightclub host?

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.598
She turned me down!

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:14.767
Huh?

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.936
I heard you ran all the way
to turn her down.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:17.895
What?

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.772
I went to tell her how I feel.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.066
But it didn't work out.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.152
Mmm.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:30.616
Then it must mean that all you could say
was garbage!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.828
I said what I needed to say.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.664
Forget it. Just leave me alone.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:43.963
I guess you just don't
have room for others.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:46.883
That's fine.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:49.927
Just give up on her.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.354
It's amazing, though.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:04.984
Sadako's life counseling with black magic
will be the main performance of our class.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.652
I know.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.826
Hey, Chizu?

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.205
What?

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.792
Thank you for doing this.

00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:26.631
For having me over
to make the costume together.

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.842
And also

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:31.928
on the roof.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.014
I was happy.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.519
I became friends with you and Ayane,

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:44.607
and I got to feel what it's like
to be truly liked for the first time.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.329
Yes, don't ever forget that.

00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:00.289
I'll go get some drinks.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.542
What do we have?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.171
Good job.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.674
Your words made her happy.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.011
Mmm, I'm glad.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:20.726
My…

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.062
words?

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:28.442
Did I even tell Kazehaya how I feel?

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:38.786
-Kazehaya, morning.
-Morning.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.187
I don't mean to butt in…

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.400
but you didn't make yourself clear.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.536
LOVE FORTUNE
GREAT/MEDIUM/SMALL/BAD

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.829
SADAKO'S BLACK MAGIC CAFÉ

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.584
CLASS D, SADAKO'S BLACK MAGIC CAFÉ
NEED ADVICE?

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.712
Shoot, it went that way!

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.506
-There's so much to do.
-Go!

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.760
Get to work, or they'll be mad.

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:37.803
What's that? Stop it.

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:40.806
Shh, shh, shh!

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.558
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.019
BOOK OF BLACK MAGIC
TEA-BLEND MASTER

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:28.437
SECRETS OF BLACK MAGIC

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:03.889
FORTUNE
GREAT LUCK

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:07.518
DEVOTE YOURSELF TO LOVE,
AND HAPPINESS SHALL FOLLOW

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:18.195
Would you like some yakisoba?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.574
Please come to Black Magic Café.
Please come.

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:23.325
She'll explain over there.

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:25.369
Let me explain.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.371
-Oh, thanks.
-There you go.

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:33.753
Thank you.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.546
-It's amazing.
-Incredible.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.299
BLACK MAGIC COUNSELING
HERBAL TEA AND HERBAL SWEETS

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:39.800
I hate her.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:43.262
The boy I like has a girlfriend,
and I hate her.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:49.560
It is said, "Before you embark
on a journey of revenge, dig two graves."

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:57.568
It means that when you curse someone,
the curse will return to you.

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.069
ON BREAK

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:03.491
Sadako's life counseling
with black magic starts in 20 minutes.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:05.868
-Sorry about that.
-Thank you.

00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:23.302
Sadako, good job.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:24.470
Master.

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.306
It's a great success.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.307
Here.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.017
Thank you.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.316
Can I be honest?

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.151
Huh?

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.528
About Kazehaya.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.533
I didn't think
you could ever win Kazehaya's heart.

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:51.080
I didn't think you two matched at all.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.124
But now,

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.502
no one can depress you,

00:13:58.295 --> 00:13:59.463
or make you cry,

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.715
or make you laugh…

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:04.760
like Kazehaya.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.979
You said you don't feel
a barrier with him.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:16.605
But to me,

00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:21.986
it seems like you create a barrier
only with him.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.363
Huh?

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.161
I'm rooting for you.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.038
Press on.

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:54.894
Kazehaya, can we talk?

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.353
What?

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:58.647
The red bean paste donut.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.274
-Well…
-Two of each?

00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:01.734
…about Sadako.

00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:04.403
I think she misunderstood you.

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.865
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's my fault.

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:10.409
Sorry.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.711
I do think

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.422
she misunderstands me.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:25.215
Huh?

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.342
But…

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:32.598
she's been misunderstood
a lot more than I have.

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.685
But she’s worked hard without giving up.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.772
Even today.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:44.860
Her efforts
are bringing smiles to everyone.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:48.739
She always

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:51.867
gives me the credit.

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:59.208
But I'm the one who admired her…

00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:04.046
for always being able to find a way.

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:17.101
DEVOTE YOURSELF TO LOVE,
AND HAPPINESS SHALL FOLLOW

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.649
-Kazehaya.
-Hey.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.902
I came to try out
the Black Magic Café.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.404
I heard it really works.

00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:31.031
What was her name again?

00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:34.493
Sadako.

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.036
Sadako Kuronuma.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.579
Sawako.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.834
It's Sawako Kuronuma.

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:52.428
-Wow, I had so much fun today!
-Me too!

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:55.180
Sawako, good job. You did great today.

00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:58.142
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:01.270
Yeah, my legs are killing me.

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.397
Your legs are like Anpanman's.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.690
Hey, that's rude.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:09.611
Sawako?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.460
The school is this way.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:27.129
Oh!

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:28.797
Thanks.

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:34.428
Kazehaya isn't feeling bad
for you either.

00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.723
You're the one who made him act like that.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.767
We're all the same.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.645
You, us, and Kazehaya…

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:48.901
It seems like you create a barrier
only with him.

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.652
Because you didn't fight for it!

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.739
You didn't make yourself clear.

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:58.327
"Sawako."

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:02.247
Your name is Sawako Kuronuma, right?

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.373
You…

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.751
You know my name?

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:07.169
Of course I do.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.170
Sawako.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.428
Sawako, what's the matter?

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:22.101
-I don't care anymore.
-Huh? Care about what?

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.852
Wait, don't tell me you're giving up.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.938
I don't care who Kazehaya likes.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.899
Chizu, Ayane, thank you.

00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:30.943
Go on without me.

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:43.956
Kazehaya,
I have so much to say to you.

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:48.418
When you blush, when you get angry,

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.840
when you get serious, when you smile.

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:55.467
I want all of it.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:04.226
Feeling scared, embarrassed,
or not wanting to be disliked…

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.355
I want to break those barriers
I put up between us.

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.151
I want you to know exactly how I feel!

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.278
From me…

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:16.488
to you!

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.699
To you!

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.450
To you!

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.175
Kuronuma?

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:42.014
I'm sorry.

00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:45.893
I'm sorry for making you cry.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.314
I'm sorry for troubling you so much.

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:53.442
I'm sorry for…

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.320
speaking so selfishly.

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:04.161
Tell me if there's
something you want to say to me.

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:06.914
I want to hear it.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.793
My feelings won't change
no matter what you say.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.637
I came to see you.

00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:27.893
Because I have something to tell you.

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:33.982
I just…

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.694
want you to listen.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:40.989
Mmm.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.705
When I first met you…

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:52.960
you smiled…

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:56.797
and said, "Thank you."

00:20:57.297 --> 00:20:58.799
It made me so happy.

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.595
You…

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.933
changed my world.

00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:12.437
But…

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:15.732
But I…

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.319
did the exact opposite…

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.031
of what you did for me.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.043
Thank you…

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.630
for smiling at me.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.636
Thank you…

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.929
…for talking to me.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.266
Thank you…

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.686
for being kind to me.

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.942
Thank you for awakening…

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:05.991
…so many feelings inside of me.

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:17.836
You've got it wrong.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.175
I like you.

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.220
I like you.

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:29.723
I like you.

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:30.891
I like you.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.226
I truly love you.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.824
Don't open it! I'm…

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.130
Kuronuma.

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:47.050
-But I--
-Look at me.

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:54.558
I feel like I've never
really looked straight at you.

00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.483
Kuronuma…

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:06.945
I love you.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:13.368
It's true.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.705
You feel the same, right?

00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.134
I want it all.

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:32.888
Kazehaya,

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.764
I want…

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:38.059
all of you.

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:49.321
Me too.

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.955
It finally reached you.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.567
-See you!
-See you later.

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:36.284
-That's Kazehaya's girlfriend, Sadako.
-Huh?

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:39.162
I heard they're dating.
They're dating, right?

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:00.767
Kurumi.

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:03.979
What do you want?

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:11.903
I confessed my love to Kazehaya.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.739
We're dating now.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.619
Are you showing off?

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:24.749
I told you before
that I wouldn't congratulate you, right?

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:26.751
Mmm.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.298
Anything else?

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:34.593
No.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.429
I just came to tell you.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.268
Sawako.

00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:50.191
I was only able to tell him how I felt…

00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:53.194
because of you.

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.407
If you weren't here,

00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:01.328
I wouldn't have been able
to tell him I how felt.

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:06.791
Although I got rejected…

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:12.839
I'm glad you were my rival.

00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:35.278
Bye!

00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:36.863
Oh!

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:45.038
I heard about the thing
you said to Sadako.

00:27:45.914 --> 00:27:46.998
So?

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:48.583
So then…

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:52.087
…you never wished Sadako
and I would end up together?

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:54.172
You're not qualified.

00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:57.967
And I…

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:03.139
don't think Kazehaya
will ever come to like me.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.396
I did something he despises the most.

00:28:17.153 --> 00:28:19.030
You're too much for Kazehaya.

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.703
You know…

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.539
if I were a boy,

00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:33.128
I would've understood
all of your dark side.

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.922
Mind your own business.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.057
Well, that was unexpected.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:48.017
What?

00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:51.062
Kazehaya's totally in love with Sadako,

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:53.565
and Kurumi is more clumsy than I thought.

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.484
And Sadako, uh…

00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.237
…she is cuter than I thought.

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:01.698
Seriously.

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:08.913
And you, Ayane,
are a lot nicer than I had thought.

00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:11.249
What do you mean by that?

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:14.753
-Let's go home together.
-Huh?

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.296
Oh, come on!

00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:18.465
I've got lots of things to tell you.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.426
Well, I guess it's all right.

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.513
Wait, which way are you headed?

00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.308
-I live that way.
-That way?

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:34.522
To see Sawako and Kazehaya
so happy makes me happy.

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.358
By the way, Chizuru…

00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:41.613
do you know what my strength is?

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:44.073
The one written
on my elementary school report card?

00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:45.074
Huh?

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:47.744
Oh, being kind?

00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:48.745
No.

00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:51.623
You don't lie?

00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:53.666
You're sincere?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.251
Oh, that you're loving?

00:29:57.879 --> 00:29:59.214
It's that I'm patient.

00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:08.681
Then what's my strength?

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.559
You're honest.

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.020
What else?

00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:23.238
Kazehaya and I
have started a new relationship.

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:24.948
What's the matter?

00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:26.950
Nothing.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:32.372
I didn't know
if I should give this to you.

00:30:32.455 --> 00:30:33.331
Huh?

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:39.712
It's the hat that I didn't get
to give you for Christmas.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:43.383
I ended up giving it to my dad,
so I made another one.

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:46.010
It's out of season now, though.

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:48.555
Thank you.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.069
Does it suit me?

00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:04.904
Mmm.

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:06.781
-Glad to hear.
-Sure.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:07.740
Thank you.

00:31:07.824 --> 00:31:08.908
Mm-mm.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.010
Oh.

00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:28.887
I'm sorry.

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.264
I tried to touch you.

00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:35.101
You're being your normal self,

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:37.937
but I'm not.

00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:45.862
Am I?

00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.157
Is that how I look to you?
