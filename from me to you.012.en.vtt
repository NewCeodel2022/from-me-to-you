00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.260
CONGRATULATIONS

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.595
GRADUATION CEREMONY

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:15.640
All right, have a seat!

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.143
This is the very last homeroom session.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.066
You know, your hairstyle looks unnatural.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.609
Be quiet.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.320
I'm trying to be proper
for your graduation.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.614
All right. Well…

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.367
Congratulations. That's all.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.162
What? That's it?

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.164
Do I need to say something?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.958
In that case…

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.418
Hmm.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.461
Well, then…

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.963
Did you all enjoy your time here?

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.549
-Yes!
-Yes.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.551
That's good to hear.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.220
However,

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.680
what awaits you all

00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.143
are times of sadness
and also times of hardship.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.105
Life is not just all fun.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.318
There are tough times

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.905
that make you feel like running away.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.326
And I don't mean once or twice,
but many times over.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.621
But during those times,

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.082
don't go blaming others.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.417
They are who they are.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.421
Just keep believing in yourself.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.632
And if you do,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.177
you'll find those
who will be on your side.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:42.060
So, even if you become hardened criminals,
I'll always be on your side.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.187
Criminals?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.189
Don't curse us like that!

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.565
Right?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.525
You're right.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.652
I mean it.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:55.657
I had the best time
being your homeroom teacher.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.576
Don't suddenly act like
a good teacher only at the end.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.081
What? I've been a great teacher
from beginning to end!

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.250
Are you allowed to call yourself great?

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.377
Of course I can, you simpleton.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.506
All right, then.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.426
Stay in good health!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.803
I cried a lot.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.556
Your picture's gonna look horrible, Chizu.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.057
Speak for yourself, Yano!

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.684
-But I--
-Right, Sawako?

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.602
-What? Really?
-Yes.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:30.608
Kurumi.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.069
Could I…

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:36.447
talk to you?

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.118
Hey, what's up?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.287
Oh, Sadako!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.455
The results will be announced soon, right?

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm praying that you get accepted, okay?

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.544
You too, Kurumi.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.588
Mmm.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.925
You're going to a college
in Sapporo, right?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.010
Mmm.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.637
Do your best in Tokyo, okay?

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.723
Mmm.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.017
When I'm away…

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:08.021
…don't cry missing me, okay?

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.024
Master.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.233
We won't.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.401
Okay.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.445
Have a good life!

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.867
Kento, he's always the same.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.455
Well…

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.837
About our freshman year…

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.006
I'm sorry.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:36.633
Huh?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.764
I found myself envious of Sawako,
who's so honest.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.017
I got irritated.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.897
I really did something horrible.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.652
I've regretted it since.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.741
I wanted to tell you before we graduate.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.245
It doesn't bother us at all anymore.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.333
I have no hard feelings from back then.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.296
Kurumi.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.509
Remember what Chizuru said back then?

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:25.682
Friends become friends
before you even realize it.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:28.351
Kurumi.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.354
We're…

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.816
already friends.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.694
Friends?

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.030
Mmm.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.286
Ugh. Crying has made me hungry.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.454
-Oh my.
-Let's grab something to eat.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:49.998
-Sure.
-Mmm.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.253
I was gonna wait to say this
until Sawako's results are in.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:03.720
But I told Pin about my feelings for him.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.055
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.517
I was totally rejected.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.103
I knew it would happen, though.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.441
I cried a lot.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.776
Ayane.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.489
Thank you both for your support.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.786
If it wasn't for you two,
I wouldn't have been able to tell him.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.831
But you both inspired me.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.461
Yano!

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:40.840
You startled me!

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:41.883
You know…

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.554
Remember when things were awkward
with Sawako in our freshman year?

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:52.101
I remember talking to Chizuru
here about you, Sawako.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.562
Oh, really?

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:57.231
-I remember that.
-Mmm.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.901
Back then, you still called us
by our last names.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.363
Everyone called me Sadako.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.782
-Oh, that's right!
-I remember.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.080
Back then, it was my goal
to be called Sawako

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.123
instead of Sadako.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.546
But after I became friends with you two,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.008
I didn't care
what anybody called me anymore.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.014
It's because I met you two

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.685
that the past three years
have been so great.

00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:37.897
Same here.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.861
I'll never forget Chizu's face.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.490
What? You had a funny look
on your face too, Yano!

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.075
Yours was funnier.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:51.536
Right?

00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:01.504
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.681
Sawako.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.100
I'm scared.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:19.939
Me too.

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:21.732
I'm shaking.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.651
Same here.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.655
You are.

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:29.198
Your hand is cold.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:35.580
Shall we?

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.457
Sure.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.507
SAPPORO UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.134
EXAM NO. 20007305
SAWAKO KURONUMA

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.390
TEACHER-TRAINING COURSE
JAPANESE LANGUAGE MAJOR

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.686
It's there!

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.689
Kurumi!

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.818
We can go to the same university!
Great!

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.404
Right!

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.281
-I'm so glad!
-Yeah!

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:23.961
Congratulations!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.881
Kazehaya, you waited for me?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.383
You waited for me when it was my turn.

00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:31.594
Remember? I couldn't sit still.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:33.554
Thank you.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:37.975
I'll walk you home.

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:47.068
Could we hold hands without our gloves?

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:49.862
Mmm.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.373
The day when we have to go
our separate ways is near.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:22.979
The train for Sapporo
is approaching platform two.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.481
Please stand behind the yellow line.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.774
Yano!

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:28.901
Ayane!

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.320
But how?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.365
Don't underestimate me! Hmm!

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:37.326
You're leaving without saying goodbye?
How rude.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.620
Let us send you off.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.960
I didn't say anything
because I knew it would be like this.

00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.380
We know that.

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.340
But still, you should have…

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.012
My makeup is gonna get messy!

00:09:56.804 --> 00:09:59.181
I wanted to look pretty when I sail off!

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.353
I knew that I…

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.149
would get so sad.

00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:17.825
Thank you!

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.955
I can't thank you enough!

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.628
That's my line.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.808
You'll be all right.

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:45.561
Mmm.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:48.481
You'll be fine in Tokyo.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:50.441
You'll be okay!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.195
I-- I'll do my best.

00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:02.328
I'll get going now.

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.390
When things get tough,

00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.768
I'll always think of you two.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:27.895
Yano.

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:30.147
Ayane.

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:33.442
The train headed for Sapporo…

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.070
-Do your best.
-…will depart from platform two.

00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:37.029
Mmm.

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:49.875
Do your best!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.919
-Ayane!
-You can do it, Yano!

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.547
-Do your best!
-Do your best!

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:07.059
I'm so glad to have met you.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:28.748
But I guess things
will never be the same again.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:47.975
Hello?

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:52.480
Kuronuma, can you help me
when I move into my new place?

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.731
I could use your help.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:54.732
Huh?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.943
Mmm, sure!

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:00.279
Thank you.

00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:01.739
I'll contact you again.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.045
It's pretty spacious.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:17.797
I see.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:21.467
I need to get a duplicate key made
before you go to Sapporo.

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.011
Come in.

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:25.721
Excuse me.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.186
-Take your time.
-Thank you.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.484
You have so many things.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:40.903
-Oh, you can put that here.
-Oh, thanks.

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.991
Okay, let's start cleaning!

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.410
That was fast.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:51.747
Okay.

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:12.059
Oh, the hat?

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.395
You brought this with you.

00:14:14.478 --> 00:14:17.565
Of course.
I brought everything you've ever given me.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.407
-Wow.
-Thank you.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.076
Wow, incredible.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.166
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:47.636
It's delicious.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.097
Mmm, I'm glad to hear that.

00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:56.645
Your new life is about to begin.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.444
I know you'll become a great teacher.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:07.281
You understand how students feel.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.409
They'll respect you for sure.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:16.832
I finally believe in a future for myself.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.630
And I'm looking forward to my new life.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.388
Kazehaya, but I know
lots of pretty girls will flock to you.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.515
What? No, they won't.

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:38.228
Mmm. You always receive
so many chocolates on Valentine's Day.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:39.980
Speak for yourself.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.942
There'll be so many guys
at your university.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.985
And you'll have your part-time job too.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.321
That'll never happen to me.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.368
Kuronuma, do you not know…

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:58.040
how pretty you are?

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:06.924
There's…

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.969
There's something I wanted to give you.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.845
Huh?

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:13.847
Clo… Close your eyes.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.477
Mmm.

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:39.957
You can open them.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:47.381
What is it?

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.679
A ring?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.223
Could I put it on for you?

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.407
Oh. Oop.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.451
Is my finger too thick?

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.621
No, no! I checked it. It's… It's thin.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.918
It might work on another finger.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:29.298
No?

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.511
Oh, um…

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.388
Oh.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:38.348
It fits!

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:43.479
Oh.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:47.107
Sorry. It shouldn't be on this finger.

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:49.276
Leave it!

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:55.407
I was just embarrassed,
so I tried your right hand.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.703
But this is what I wanted.

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:06.460
Thank you.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:10.297
I'll cherish it forever.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.552
Someday…

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:21.016
I'll give you one
that's meant for a lifetime.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.644
I promise.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:34.446
Don't be sad,
or I'll start to cry.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.498
It all began
with a misunderstanding.

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.376
But then we started dating,

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.879
and holding hands became natural for us.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.842
Time has been good to us.

00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:56.969
And now…

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.264
we're so deeply connected.

00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:05.477
Thanks for your help.

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:07.729
Mmm.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.319
I should…
I should send you home.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:16.822
Oh.

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:51.773
Kuronuma?

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:01.617
I don't want to go home.

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:05.287
-Kuronuma--
-I know.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.123
I know it.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.669
We'll be okay, even when we're far apart.

00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:17.174
I know I can come see you whenever I want.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.804
But…

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.767
I don't want to go home.

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:32.648
If you really mean it,
then I'll take you back with me.

00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:37.861
That's what I want.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.790
Let's go back.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.251
Mmm.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.297
Mom, you know…

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.342
I won't be coming home today.

00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:06.056
You won't? Not that you can't, right?

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.352
Mmm.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:15.482
Okay.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.485
Come home safely tomorrow.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:20.654
Sorry.

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.031
Bye.

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:28.161
Bye.

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.537
Sawako, you're leaving tomorrow, right?

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.582
I'll say bye here for Kazehaya's sake.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.418
Mmm.

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.712
Sanada is leaving tomorrow too, right?

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:19.671
Mmm.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.467
I cried too much when Yano left,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.511
so I'm going to see you
and Ryu off with smiles.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:29.473
Mmm.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.309
Sawako.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.563
I'm glad we became friends.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:40.776
You made my high school life so much fun.

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.779
Thank you.

00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:46.156
Chizu.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.287
Thank you for everything.

00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.917
Let's keep in touch.

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:01.463
Do your best, Sawako.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:05.175
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:07.719
-Come back anytime.
-Mmm.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.144
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:20.982
-Thanks.
-Sure.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:24.111
-I'll get in first.
-Okay.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.501
I guess I'll get going, Chizuru.

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:51.847
It's okay to cry.

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:55.684
See you.

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.784
YESTERDAY:
I'LL SEE YOU OFF!

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:13.702
THANKS!

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:17.038
TODAY:
WE'LL GET MARRIED AFTER I GRADUATE

00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:29.509
I'm really going to be waiting for you!

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.720
Idiot!

00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:36.475
BASEBALL IDIOT

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.019
Go for it!

00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:00.081
I'll go now.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.292
Are you sure we don't need to come?

00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.711
Mmm, I'll be fine.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.880
I'll take you to the station.

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:08.798
Mmm.

00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:10.717
I want to say goodbye at home.

00:25:14.971 --> 00:25:19.017
Thank you
for taking care of me for 18 years.

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:21.603
Go on.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.066
Mmm, I will.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.697
OSAKAYA HARDWARE

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.908
KEY DUPLICATION

00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:37.619
BE RIGHT BACK.
STORE MANAGER

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.708
My phone… No.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.550
No way.

00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:58.557
SEE YOU ON THE PLATFORM IN 30.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.891
THANKS. SEE YOU THEN!

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:15.907
-Hey, I'm, uh, sorry to keep you waiting.
-Sure.

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.367
Uh, here you go.

00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.869
-Thanks.
-No problem.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.432
The train headed
for Sapporo is approaching.

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:42.851
Please stand behind the yellow line.

00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:02.996
Stay behind the yellow line.

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:07.834
The train headed for Sapporo…

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.680
Kuronuma!

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:23.642
Kazehaya!

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:26.686
I'm sorry for being late.

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.814
I… I wrote a letter for you.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.192
Read it on the train.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.445
Mmm, thanks.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.494
Take care.

00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:46.164
-The train headed for Sapporo…
-Mmm.

00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:48.541
…is departing from platform two.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.127
I'll get going.

00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:00.512
Sawako.

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:06.726
I love you.

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:10.063
No matter what.

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.067
Shota!

00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:16.444
I love you too!

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.410
To Kuronuma.

00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:10.039
This is a response to the letter
you gave me on my birthday last year.

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:15.253
My world has changed ever since I met you.

00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:20.633
I used to be impatient
and always run around for no reason.

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.764
But you taught me
the joy of walking slowly.

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:32.020
I would get anxious or sad in college,

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:35.607
but I'd contact you during those times.

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:40.236
I'd text you and call you.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.907
Once I see you again,

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.619
the distance and the time that has passed
between us won't matter at all.

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.247
My heart will go on
even though you're away.

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:56.419
I'll always love you.

00:29:58.087 --> 00:29:59.714
Shota Kazehaya.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.358
Our love will continue.

00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:24.697
And may this love reach from me…

00:30:28.284 --> 00:30:31.246
always and forever…

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.208
to you.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.587
To you.

00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:42.715
To you.

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.207
Welcome back!

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:19.252
I'm home!
