1-D CHRISTMAS PARTY ATTENDEES

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.205
-Oh, you're still here.
-Mmm.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.333
The teacher asked me to do something.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.713
Aren't you going?

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.423
Well…

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.634
I need to ask my parents first.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:53.762
Let's go.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.847
Let's all go together.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.226
Mmm, I'd like that.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.193
I've dreamed
of spending Christmas with friends.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.571
I hope I can go with others.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.293
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.004
-Oh, it's math.
-Can I have a bite?

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.132
-I hate it.
-It's delicious!

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.175
Chizuru.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.762
I need to talk to you.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.514
I don't.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.475
Move it!

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.358
What?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.902
It's about the other day.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.321
Are you finally apologizing?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.825
No, I am not.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.368
Huh?

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.872
Were you thinking that all along?

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.877
You thought I liked Toru
even though I had no chance with him?

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.467
I did not love him only to be heartbroken!

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:22.392
I didn't go there to see Toru on that day!

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.855
I wanted to give you the present,
so I pushed myself to go there!

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:31.943
I…

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.447
I just wanted to see him one more time.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.077
Don't talk to me.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.460
At least let me thank you.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.887
Chizu.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.230
The other day

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.151
when I went to give Ryu his present,

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:14.652
he said

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:20.575
that he knew that my love for Toru
was hopeless.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.247
That idiot is too honest!

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.752
Was he pitying me all these years?

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.464
I'm pissed!

00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:38.718
He pisses me off!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.764
Chizu.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:49.896
But…

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:57.028
…I'm most pissed at myself
for taking it out on Ryu.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.325
That's all I'm capable of now.

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.665
Finally, you're sulking.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.169
Good.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.797
Mmm.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.895
I feel better.

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:32.438
Thanks.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.986
But I'm actually thankful
for Ryu's presence.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.533
Because you took it out on him,
you were able to let it out.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.368
Mmm.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.413
I wasn't really aware of it,

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.125
but arguing with Ryu made me realize…

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:58.256
that I really wanted
to talk with Toru just one more time.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.265
What is it, Sawako?

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:09.559
Chi.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.022
Toru!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.858
Why?

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.484
I came to see you.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.612
Sorry, but will you excuse us?

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:30.371
Chizu.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.252
You're wearing a miniskirt.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.717
You're right.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.892
When did you come?

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.060
Just now.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.062
I finished work early.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.022
I won't be staying the night, though.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.565
That's tough.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.486
Don't you worry about it.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.114
I wanted to walk with you today.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.868
Wait…

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:10.453
Huh?

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:16.376
What… What do you think?
I'm wearing a miniskirt.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:20.171
Oh.It looks great!

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:21.923
You can stand the cold, huh?

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.927
You used to wear shorts
even in the winter.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.304
Don't treat me like a little kid.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.474
You're young.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.977
Dammit.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.411
Oh, hey.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.162
Look at this shrine.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:57.291
You used to catch stag beetles here
in the middle of the night.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.920
I remember that.

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:02.797
Chi.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.715
What are you doing out
at such a late hour?

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.384
I was looking for stag beetles.

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.677
It's late.

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.972
-Then let's go home together.
-Sure.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.270
You know you won't find them
on such a rainy day.

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:18.646
They're still there.

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:22.525
We used to walk this road a lot.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:24.735
You remember so well.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.195
Of course I do.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.365
I remember when you fell right over there.

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.618
Or when Ryu would make you cry.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.164
How do you remember all of that?

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.541
Does Ryu still make you cry?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.710
Of course not!

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.837
-I'm serious.
-Oh.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.005
He really doesn't.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.924
Okay.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.262
But I do…

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.141
get annoyed with him for no good reason

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.393
or take things out on him.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.023
Well, he never lies.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.694
He might say
the same things others say to you,

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:10.698
but it might be annoying coming from him,
especially for you.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.200
Mmm.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.203
I know…

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.456
he's actually really kind.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.711
I see.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.131
So you two fight like that, huh?

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.262
You look great in that uniform.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.643
It reminds me
that you're already in high school.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:47.818
Toru.

00:08:50.821 --> 00:08:51.781
Congra…

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:02.458
Chi.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.629
Say, "Chi."

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:08.965
Huh?

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.216
Just do it.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.926
Do you know why I call you that?

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.178
I have no idea.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.765
-Chi?
-Do it properly.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:22.436
Chi?

00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:26.607
Mmm.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.317
Now you're smiling.

00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:35.908
Toru.

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:42.206
I like you.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.253
So do I.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.760
Mmm.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.891
I'm just a neighborhood kid,

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.897
but can I stop by when you're back?

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.109
Chi.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.863
Don't be so formal!

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:14.905
Ooh!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.659
You're my little sister.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.372
Little sister, huh?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.501
You're cuter than Ryu. But don't tell him.

00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:31.130
Mmm.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.257
Thank you.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:39.013
Toru!

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:45.645
Congratulations on your marriage!

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.564
Thanks.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.654
RAMEN
TETSURYUKEN

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:07.792
Hey.

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:10.419
How is Chizuru?

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.672
I sent her home safely.

00:11:15.466 --> 00:11:19.136
Both of you are kind of clumsy, you know?

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.434
Press on.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.604
You're a better fit for her.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.318
Bro!

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.074
I think so too.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.056
Want me to comfort you?

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.816
I went to your house,
but your mom told me you're still out.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:20.865
You were here
when he left for Sapporo too.

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:28.914
Didn't I tell you not to talk
to me for a while?

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.377
Then I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:38.674
I didn't mean it.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:40.426
Sorry.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:50.478
You're the one
who called Toru, aren't you?

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.649
I was happy.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.320
Thank you.

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:07.995
Thank you for the birthday present.

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:16.337
You know, you were right.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.132
I…

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.093
I think even I…

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.847
doubted that my dream would come true.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.983
Maybe I knew that this day
would eventually come.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.117
To me, I guess he was just
a big brother I looked up to--

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:48.160
Yeah, I know.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.465
I know that your feeling for him was real.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.903
Comfort me…

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.405
…Ryu.

00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.509
-Aw, here you go.
-Thanks.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.932
All right.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.059
Let's eat.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:14:59.523
Dad.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.986
About Christmas this year…

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.447
-Actually--
-I took the day off.

00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.867
My dear, I'm all yours from the morning.

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:12.912
Okay?

00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:16.498
Mmm.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.666
Sawako.

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:22.296
Actually, you were due on the 24th.

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:25.007
Mmm, I remember.

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.677
You were overdue, so we were worried.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:31.889
You ended up being born on New Year's Eve.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.891
And do you know what?

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.061
You were by far the best gift to us.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:43.609
Huh? You aren't going?

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:44.818
Mmm.

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.988
Dad is so excited
about our Christmas party.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:50.532
-Can't you step out for a bit?
-Mmm.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.993
We usually spend the whole day together.

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:58.082
Oh, it's a bit early, but…

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:00.793
Here.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.253
-Wow, really?
-What? What is this?

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.339
What is this?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.425
It's so cute!

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:10.594
What? An apron?

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.973
-Wow!
-It's so cute! Thank you, Sawako!

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.517
-I'll cherish this.
-It's so cute!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.727
-It looks great on you.
-It does.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.313
It's so cute.
We have the same flower pattern.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.356
What's that?

00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:24.692
Look,
they're Christmas presents from Sawako.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.609
Wow!

00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:29.446
But why didn't you wait
until the Christmas party?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:34.326
Well, my family is doing
something on that day, so I can't go.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.209
-You aren't coming?
-It was delicious.

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:43.961
-Where was it?
-Mmm.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.588
I hope you guys have fun.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.718
Okay.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.096
Wait.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.144
I mean…

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.106
"Thank you for everything."

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.317
"I had a great year, thanks to you."

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.779
Kazehaya, come on.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:11.780
Okay.

00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:19.496
Bye-bye. Happy holidays.

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.835
The winter break
starts tomorrow.

00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:28.088
I won't see him until next semester.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.218
-Yes!
-Wow!

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.386
Good job!

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.387
Yes!

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.932
You're up next, Ryu.
You better get a strike.

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:41.769
Yes!

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:44.229
He's actually horrible at bowling.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:45.314
Yes!

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.905
I didn't think
I could give this to him anyway.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.158
What can I do?

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.627
Sawako, we're ready to go.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.754
Mmm.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.966
Sawako, is that…

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.009
What?

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.636
Here we are.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:17.554
All right.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.557
Merry Christmas!

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.938
Mmm!

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.773
-Mmm.
-It's so good.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:28.690
Let's start.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.735
Dad's homemade pizza.

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.279
Here you go, Sawako.

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:36.365
Hmm?

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:39.701
Is everything okay? Are you having fun?

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:41.537
Mmm.

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.039
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.666
-Enjoy
-He was busy all day making it.

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:46.583
-I know.
-It's tasty.

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:50.212
-I'll answer it.
-Mmm.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:56.093
Hello, this is Kuronuma.

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:58.178
Is this Sawako?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.555
Chizu?

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.099
What's up? Are you doing okay?

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.101
We were worried about you.

00:19:04.184 --> 00:19:05.394
Mmm.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.604
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:11.483
Sawako, we have
a Christmas present for you.

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:13.026
Huh?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.408
She must be surprised.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.493
Kuronuma?

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.120
Kazehaya.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:28.750
Sawako?

00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:31.753
Is it your friends?

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.089
Let me greet them.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.552
Hello, this is Sawako's mom speaking.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.763
Are you all having
a Christmas party over there?

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.183
It sounds fun.

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:45.851
Yes.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:50.981
But it would be more…
much more fun if Kuronuma were here.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.066
Oh, I see.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.860
Thank you.

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:57.946
Hold on a sec.

00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:01.909
Hey, Dad…

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.955
Would it be okay
to join them just for a bit?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:13.420
Okay, but next time, tell me earlier.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.185
Kazehaya.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.022
The party finished.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.651
They all went to karaoke.

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.197
You missed the gift exchange.

00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:48.247
But this is for you.

00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:06.974
Thanks.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.605
Oh.

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:19.778
Actually, I prepared
something for you too,

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:23.740
but I don't have it anymore.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.830
All I have now is…

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.296
Can I open it?

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:39.423
Mmm.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.806
It's a belly warmer.

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:52.978
You could give it to your grandpa
or grandma or something.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:54.438
Can I keep it?

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.318
Mmm.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.320
Thank you.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.113
I'll cherish it.

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.579
Should we go and join them?

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:13.373
Mmm.

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:20.881
Can I put it on now?

00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.883
Mmm.

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:28.347
Hey!

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.528
Hey, you guys having a great time?

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:46.281
-Why is he here?
-What?

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.369
Merry Christmas!

00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:59.461
Merry Christmas! Whoo-hoo!

00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:05.592
Hey, Kuronuma!

00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.010
Are you having fun?

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.513
-Mmm, I am.
-Good.

00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.765
You seem to be having fun too, Mr. Arai.

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:12.933
I'm here out of spite

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.644
because my group blind date
was canceled last minute.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:18.772
You were hanging out with Shota again.

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:20.232
What?

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.694
He's a good guy, no?

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:27.697
Yes, he really is.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.909
I wish I could repay him
for everything he's done.

00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.786
Mmm.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.287
Then let me tell you this.

00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.916
I've known him for quite a bit,
so I know this for a fact.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.554
All right, everybody!
Head straight home, okay?

00:23:50.637 --> 00:23:53.265
This party's over.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:58.645
Kazehaya, can you take Sawako home?

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.523
Mmm.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:03.859
Shall we?

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.361
Mmm.

00:24:09.072 --> 00:24:10.323
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:11.408
Take care.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.665
They already look like they're dating.

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:24.171
This is the best Christmas ever.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.507
I'm glad your father let you come.

00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:31.845
Kazehaya.

00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:01.374
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:05.378
-You startled me.
-Wha… What? You didn't mean to--

00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.963
Mr. Arai told me that…

00:25:07.797 --> 00:25:09.216
P… Pin?

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:12.594
He told me to grab you and close my eyes
when showing gratitude to you.

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:13.512
What?

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.597
I… I can't believe him.

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.016
I'm sorry.

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:21.394
I didn't quite understand
how this could be showing gratitude.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:24.481
I want to…

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:28.068
thank you for everything.

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:43.083
If you ever do that again,
don't be surprised at what happens!

00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:54.594
ONE GOOD DEED A DAY

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:06.106
Hey, Chizu, Ayane, what's going on?

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.739
This is a birthday present from us to you.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:17.242
Happy birthday.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:21.371
Thank you.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.250
-You look cute.
-Yeah, you look great!

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.376
-You think so?
-Yeah.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.879
-You look great in that outfit.
-You look so pretty.

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:37.137
Spending New Year's Eve with you two
makes me feel like I'm in a dream.

00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:45.979
What is it?

00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:48.565
The meeting spot
is right around the corner,

00:26:48.648 --> 00:26:49.983
so we should take off.

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:52.527
Then let's get going, Yano.
And Ryu knows too.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.030
What?

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.906
Have a great time with Kazehaya.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.408
Bye!

00:26:58.491 --> 00:26:59.909
Huh? Wait.

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.779
Ryu isn't here yet.

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.491
How about Yoshida and Yano?

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.118
They're not coming.

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:45.497
Sanada isn't coming either.

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.059
-Oh!
-Watch out!

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.277
Whoa.

00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:21.491
It seems to be going well.

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:23.451
You guys are horrible.

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.287
I'll follow up, just in case.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.461
Oh, Yoshida?

00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:35.630
Mmm.

00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:39.342
-Mmm. It's from Yoshida.
-Chizu?

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.428
Sorry, but we can't make it.

00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:43.680
Something came up for Ryu too.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.682
Oh, mmm.

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:48.727
Forget about us and just enjoy.

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:52.480
By the way,
do you know what day it is today?

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:56.276
What?

00:29:00.196 --> 00:29:01.406
What did Chizu say?

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.534
Something came up, so they can't come.

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:06.453
I see.

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:10.874
Also, when is your birthday?

00:29:11.374 --> 00:29:12.208
Huh?

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.130
Today.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.466
Today's almost over!

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.595
I almost missed it.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:27.307
Happy birthday.

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:35.064
If I'd have known,
I would've given you something.

00:29:38.818 --> 00:29:39.819
Mmm.

00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:41.237
You already have.

00:29:42.155 --> 00:29:43.031
What?

00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:50.705
You've given me experiences
that I've never had before.

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:55.835
I've experienced happiness
more than I ever imagined.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:58.463
And…

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:02.342
hearing you say, "Happy birthday."

00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:10.767
I'm really thankful.

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:14.062
Mmm.

00:30:18.274 --> 00:30:20.026
Let's get in line.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.737
Mmm.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.620
And I got to see
a different side of you.

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.167
I got to know more about you.

00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:37.293
Okay, you ready?

00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:41.422
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.634
six, five, four,

00:30:44.717 --> 00:30:49.597
three, two, one, zero!

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:53.351
Happy New Year!

00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:56.229
Happy New Year.

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.147
Happy New Year.

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.109
Hoping for another great year.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:03.903
Yeah, same here.

00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.661
Yes! It says, "Great luck."

00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:13.329
Wow, great!

00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.331
YOU HAVE ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD

00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:17.542
My turn.

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:23.131
BAD LUCK, BUT IT GETS BETTER,
LIKE FLOWERS BLOOMING IN SPRING

00:31:28.177 --> 00:31:29.971
You can have mine.

00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:32.640
But…

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:36.394
I don't want to make you unlucky.

00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:37.562
Don't worry.

00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:39.522
Luck's on my side.

00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:41.733
Also,

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:49.282
I want to give it to you,
although it's a cheesy birthday present.

00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:58.833
The past year was full of firsts.

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.501
Thank you.

00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.254
It was a memorable year.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.050
I wonder what this year will bring.
