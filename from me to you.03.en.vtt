WEBVTT

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.889
Whoa!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.692
Here.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.987
Oh, thank you.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.366
-Kurumi, let's get going.
-Hmm?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.576
Oh.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.619
-See you.
-Sure.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.831
-Sorry to keep you waiting!
-Kurumi, huh?

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:51.468
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.850
Mmm! Pops, it's delicious as always!

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.561
Right?
If you need refills, let me know.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.688
Mmm.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:04.814
How is it?

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.569
Ramen is so delicious
when you're eating with friends.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.739
-Everything was great!
-See you next time!

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:17.619
Stir-fried vegetables and one miso ramen…

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:20.371
Huh? I thought I saw Sanada just now.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.874
Of course, this is his family's shop.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.334
Huh? Really?

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.879
Oh! In his room, Ryu's got a picture
of when Kazehaya played baseball.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:28.838
What?

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.007
I'll show you later.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:37.597
Sawako, this place is like home to me,
so just relax.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.182
Mmm.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.767
Come. Sit here.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.437
Put your bag down, enjoy some snacks.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.106
Thank you.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.317
Sorry, I'm hanging out with some friends,
so I can't go.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.488
Okay, I'll text you.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.406
See you.

00:01:56.407 --> 00:02:00.286
-Your boyfriend in university?
-Yeah, he's so possessive.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.206
-Oh my.
-You have a boyfriend, Yano?

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:05.500
You're so grown up.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.337
Hey, wait,
we're having a girl talk!

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.505
This is my room.

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.595
Um, are you two dating by any chance?

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:22.851
No way!

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.478
We've known each other since childhood.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.438
She's like a brother.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.358
-Wait, who's the older brother?
-I am.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.402
What?
Your birthday is after mine.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.155
-I am the older brother.
-Hey, let's have Kazehaya join us.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.823
Oh, great idea!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.576
-Ryu, give me your phone.
-Okay.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.035
Here.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.959
RYU MOBILE NUMBER

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.463
Hey, Ryu. What's up?

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:54.716
Uh, this is…

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.010
K… Kuronuma.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.053
What? Kuronuma?

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.400
Kazehaya's hair was so short!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.529
-He used to play baseball, right?
-Yeah.

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.574
Shota's really good at baseball.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.576
Pin was disappointed
when he didn't join the team.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:23.870
Is he really?

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.873
I wish I could have seen him.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:32.170
His hair was longer than
the others on the team.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.463
His hair grows quickly.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.758
He must be dirty-minded, but he hides it.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.262
Hey, I'm dirty-minded,
but I don't hide it!

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.182
What's with you? Are you admitting
that you're dirty-minded?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.850
I'm totally normal.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.521
Oh,
you made Sawako laugh, Kazehaya.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.565
Hey, don't laugh, Kuronuma.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.734
Oh, I'm not laughing at you.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:56.778
I just…

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.238
I'm just kidding.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.115
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.868
Sawako.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.414
That's what they call you?

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.625
Oh, yeah.

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:14.712
Yoshida and Yano call me by my real name.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.840
I'm still getting used to it, Sawako.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.426
She still calls us by our surnames.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.595
Mmm, I just can't help it.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:23.888
Just try it.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.849
Well…

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.186
Chizu, Ayane…

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.230
I like it.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.859
Which one should I pick?

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.820
Mmm, this one.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.781
-Ah, yes! I got it!
-Whoa.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.410
Hey, are you playing soccer
for Sports Day, Sawako?

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.414
Yes, but I'm so bad at it.
So I need to practice.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.166
Huh? Aren't you good at running, though?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.502
-I thought you were pretty athletic.
-Mmm.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.379
Do you have a ball?

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.380
No.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.133
I'm thinking of borrowing the school's.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.260
-I see.
-Ooh.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.430
I thought I heard
a bunch of noise up here.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.057
Time for you kids to go home.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.476
-Pin?
-Hey, don't come in here!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.103
Why are you here, Mr. Arai?

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.148
What's all this?
Flirting and making memories?

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:16.858
Yes.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.111
This will be a memorable day.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.405
Good.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.532
-Okay, just go home, Pin.
-Huh? You go home.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.617
Huh? Don't start acting
like a teacher suddenly.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.536
-Shut up. The party's over.
-Stop it!

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.038
You're far too young for this.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.831
Get up, or it'll affect your report card.

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:33.082
-What?
-What?

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.584
-Get up. Let's go
-Go away.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:35.501
RAMEN
TETSURYUKEN

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.753
Bye!

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.838
-See you.
-Watch her for us, Kazehaya.

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:40.256
Sure.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:41.841
I'll get going too.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.384
-Bye, Chizu.
-Bye.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.812
Sawako?

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:01.152
You know my name?

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.447
Of course.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.907
Call me Kurumi.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.742
Huh? Really?

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:08.951
Of course!

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:11.704
Thank you.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.290
I've heard about you.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.626
Me?

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.462
Yeah. All of your classmates
used your notes for the exams,

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.298
and the class average went up like crazy.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.220
It's actually
a good rumor for the first time.

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:32.600
I'd like to borrow your notes if possible.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.564
Sure, if you think they'll help.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.948
Hey, Kuronuma.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.077
-Oh, hey, Kurumi.
-Kazehaya!

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.371
Her name's…

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:55.957
You're in the Sports Day Committee, right?
Me too.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.459
-Oh, seriously? Me too.
-Mmm. Right?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.587
You two seem to be good friends.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.798
We went to the same middle school.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.051
Oh, I didn't know you two were friends.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.638
We just became friends, right?

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.683
Mmm.

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:19.105
This is how you use
the relative pronoun "what."

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.316
With pronouns, nouns, or adjectives,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.612
the word "want" refers
to situations or things.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.614
TO KURONUMA, FROM KAZEHAYA

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.408
Let's look at some examples.

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:32.743
I HAVE A BALL.
LET'S PRACTICE AFTER SCHOOL. KAZE

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.205
For example, "I don't know what he did."

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.332
The what clause is…

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.107
Oh.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:30.927
Let's go.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.309
What is this?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.896
He seems a bit different today.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:40.871
It reached me!

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.296
Great.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:50.756
Good job, Kuronuma.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.425
-Mmm.
-Awesome!

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.143
-Oops.
-Here! Here!

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.188
Thanks for the notes.
They were really helpful.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.149
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.484
I'm glad to hear that.

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:15.615
Sawako's been spending a lot of time
with Kurumi these days.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.202
Kurumi, she's not a bad girl, but…

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.414
I guess it's okay if Sawako is happy.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.625
What? What do you mean?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.293
I told you that.

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:31.589
The girls made that "Everyone's Kazehaya"
pact in middle school.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:34.467
They agreed that no one
could confess their love to him.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.803
It was Kurumi's idea.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.971
What a bother.

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.433
Oh, I see.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.729
Sawako, what do you talk about
with Kazehaya?

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:52.193
-Well, about Sports Day and such.
-Hmm.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.946
But recently…

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.741
Recently? What?

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:05.414
Recently, I've been feeling nervous
around him.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.459
Oh, that's all?

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.544
A bit sensitive.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.631
-Am I?
-You are.

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:19.011
Kazehaya, he just doesn't want anyone
to be excluded.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.430
So don't be too self-conscious.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.433
Oh, I see.

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.895
I've known him for a long time,

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.606
so we know what each other is thinking.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.109
We're more than just friends.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.736
More than friends?

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:38.864
Mmm.

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:42.868
Yeah, so you don't need
to think of him too highly.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:46.288
Just treat him like a classmate.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.212
Can I try some?

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.089
-Oh.
-You can try some of mine.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.341
-Sure.
-Is it okay?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.885
43RD KITAHORO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS DAY

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.016
All right.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.017
Done!

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.145
You look so cute!

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.646
-Look!
-What do you think?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.399
-Do you like it?
-Wow, thank you!

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:14.817
-How cute!
-Great!

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.944
-The bun looks great on you.
-Really?

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.449
Sawako!

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.366
Chizu!

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.203
Go, Chizu!

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:30.666
Nice! Yes!

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:40.885
Kuronuma!

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:43.095
-I'll catch up with you later.
-Sure.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:45.389
How was the game?

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.057
Uh, we won.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:49.852
I was able to kick the ball.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.562
Thank you.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:53.147
Seriously? Great!

00:12:57.234 --> 00:12:58.152
Sawako.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:12:59.862
Kurumizawa.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.114
Kurumizawa?

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.825
That's her name.
Kurumizawa Ume.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:05.951
Kazehaya!

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.124
Um, I wanted to speak with Sawako.
Is it all right?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:13.709
Oh, mmm.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.795
Thanks.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.630
Mmm.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:19.757
See you later.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.554
I didn't know your name is Ume.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.140
Can I call you Ume?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.850
No, don't!

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.813
I don't like that name.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:36.524
I like it.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:38.859
I mean, they call me Sadako.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:41.862
It's Sawako. It's a great name.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.746
We're friends, aren't we?

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:54.708
Mmm.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.796
Sawako, you know…

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.924
There's someone I like.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.342
What?

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.762
I need your help.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.225
I want to date him,
but I don't have the confidence.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.979
Are you sure you need my help?

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:20.067
Actually, it has to be you.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.531
Sure, I'll do whatever I can.

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.991
Really?

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:28.701
Great!

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:31.912
Because you know him well.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.706
What?

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:34.999
It's Kazehaya.

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:39.461
I…

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:41.755
like him.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.301
Kazehaya?

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:52.182
You're the first person
who I've ever told who I like.

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:53.767
Thanks.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.064
Sawako, I'm so happy
that you're on my side.

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.035
Sorry.

00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:12.786
Hmm?

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:16.582
I can't do it.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.043
Why not?

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.420
Aren't we friends?

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:24.131
You said you'd help me.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:31.847
Because we're friends…

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.895
I can't help
if I'm not really cheering for you inside.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.022
What?

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.192
Kazehaya…

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:46.362
is someone special to me.

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.490
Special?

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.536
I'm sorry I can't help you.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.873
Why aren't you backing down?

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.125
Don't you see you're beneath me?

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:02.711
What?

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.630
What?

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.674
Do you want to date him too?

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.842
Oh, not at all!

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:10.928
Then what does "special" mean?

00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:13.097
-Well--
-Because he's nice to you?

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.890
-No.
-Because he's kind to you?

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.101
-Well--
-It's just charity.

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.481
I'm serious about him.

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:26.694
You're so sneaky.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:29.863
Just because you're gloomy
and others stay away from you,

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.282
you got his attention without any effort.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:36.286
I have to work hard
because I'm pretty and popular.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:41.667
Wait!

00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:48.173
Why do I have to watch this
with you after having a talk like that?

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:52.386
Kurumi, I thought
you might want to cheer him on.

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.013
I do, but…

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.115
About what you said just before…

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.077
You love him, right?

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:24.752
It's the first time I've ever said that.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.755
Yours isn't the same as mine.

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.382
You don't talk to other boys.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:35.554
Just because he was a bit kind to you,
you convinced yourself that he's special.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:40.392
It's true that I have no one
to compare him with.

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:45.064
Why don't you try talking
to other boys too?

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.192
-Other boys?
-Mmm.

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.277
Oh!

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:54.073
Watch out!

00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:02.790
Sorry to scare you.

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:06.168
-Hey, Noguchi, be careful.
-Sorry about that.

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.544
You sure you can pitch?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.631
Oh, I didn't thank him!

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.716
Oh, yeah. There's Sanada!

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:15.469
Why don't you try talking to him more?

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:17.346
-Sanada?
-Mmm.

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.516
Both Sanada and Kazehaya have helped you.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.310
He doesn't avoid you, right?

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:28.565
If you talked to him more,
he might just become special to you too.

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.611
Okay.

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:38.575
Sanada?

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.203
Sorry to wake you.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.501
I was waiting for you.

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:54.299
You gave me this note.

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.761
A note?

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:05.269
Well, did someone tell you to come here?

00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:07.646
Mmm.

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:10.149
Kurumi told me that you'd be here.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.651
I see.

00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:17.781
Oh, thank you for what you did.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.200
I didn't get hurt thanks to you.

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:22.828
I just happen to be in the right place.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:36.967
Anything else?

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.845
Oh, well…

00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.097
Well…

00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:46.310
actually, I wanted to talk with you.

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:50.105
Okay, about what?

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:57.613
Do…

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.618
you know what romantic love is?

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.747
Romantic love?

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:08.916
Mmm.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.376
Hmm.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:13.921
I do.

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:17.049
Chizu is the only one for me.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.097
Keep it a secret, okay?

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:26.934
I see.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:31.230
I think you two would be great together.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.362
Thank you for helping me.

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:40.530
Mmm, no problem.

00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:46.286
Sawako kept looking at Sanada today.

00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.457
-Ryu?
-Mmm.

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:55.337
Maybe she'll fall for him
after being rescued by him like that.

00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.882
We should cheer her on.

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:03.637
When did you start to like Yoshida?

00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:06.640
When?

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.308
Hmm.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.978
I don't remember.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.274
How did you know she's special to you?

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:19.111
Do you need a reason for that?

00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:24.116
She's always just been special to me.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.535
No one compares to her.

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.415
She's special
because no one else compares to her?

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:33.542
I'm not sure.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.877
Do you want it to be so?

00:21:49.349 --> 00:21:52.311
See? Something's going on between them.

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:56.648
Kazehaya?

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:10.662
But why?

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:49.493
Ryu…

00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:51.787
Do you like him?

00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:03.090
No.

00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:05.634
What I feel for him

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.512
isn't romantic love.

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.599
Okay.

00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:16.019
Good.

00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:22.984
I'm sorry about just now.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.124
Where did Sawako go?

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:38.875
Really?

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.963
Hey, Ryu, did you see Sawako?

00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:46.049
Huh? She asked me to meet her
in the gym equipment room.

00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:47.926
Gym equipment room?

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.929
Yeah. But it wasn't from her.

00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:52.431
Hmm.

00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:56.768
It's not her handwriting.

00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:01.064
Did you happen to see Kurumi there too?

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:04.067
Yeah, with Shota.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:11.658
There you are.

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:18.790
What?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.876
This.

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.921
You pretended to be Sawako to summon Ryu.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.133
That's not all.

00:24:29.342 --> 00:24:30.510
We know everything.

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.764
You're the one
who spread those bad rumors.

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:37.184
I heard it from someone else.

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:38.977
Huh? Don't play innocent!

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.812
I said I don't know!

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.816
What's happening?

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.449
Sawako…

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.162
Kurumi.

00:24:57.245 --> 00:24:58.330
She's using you.

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.124
What?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.960
She's the one who spread those rumors.

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:06.296
The rumors?

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:11.301
About you bringing down our popularity
or Kazehaya's popularity.

00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:13.553
And about bad-mouthing us.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:19.226
And now she's pretending
to be your friend.

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.896
Pretending?

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.067
It must be

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:29.486
a misunderstanding.

00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:33.406
Right?

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:42.332
No, it's not.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:46.127
It was me.

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.337
It was all me.

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:51.591
The rumors about them and about you.

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.302
I spread them all.

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:01.810
Because you're in my way, Sawako.

00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.355
Kurumi…

00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.276
do…

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.028
you hate me?

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:15.407
You just realized that?

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:20.370
I've never thought of you as a friend.

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.174
Sawako…

00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.390
You're horrible.

00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:46.271
Don't ever make her cry again!

00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:54.237
Fine.

00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:56.114
Just leave her alone.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.866
Let's go, Sawako.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.969
What?

00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:22.974
I like Kazehaya.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:30.315
I'm in love with Kazehaya.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.866
My heart is pounding.

00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:46.539
It's so nerve-racking
to share such feelings to a friend.

00:27:47.123 --> 00:27:48.958
I told you we aren't friends.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.504
I told you, you're in my way!

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.927
I believed I could beat you.

00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.681
Because…

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:05.684
…I like Kazehaya…

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.813
much more than you do.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.190
I know it!

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.653
Don't think we're the same.

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.700
But it doesn't matter.

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.664
It doesn't matter if…

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.791
…he doesn't like me.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:34.587
I knew it.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:39.008
I knew it's not me that he likes.

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:44.597
Because I know him.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.985
It's clean.

00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.780
You won't be cursed.

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:04.075
That's not I was thinking!

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:13.543
I hate you.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.353
Hey, Kurumizawa.
I'm sorry I left you hanging back there.

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:33.438
It's okay.

00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:37.817
Kazehaya?

00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:42.530
I…

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:47.327
I've always liked you.

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:55.752
Sorry.

00:29:57.045 --> 00:29:58.713
There's someone else I like.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.717
Of course.

00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:05.678
I knew that.

00:30:08.348 --> 00:30:09.974
Kazehaya,

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:14.604
does it make you even a little bit happy
to know that I like you?

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:17.816
Mmm.

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.276
Thank you.

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:22.821
Mmm.

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:42.674
Kurumi?

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:50.014
Even if things go well
between you and Kazehaya,

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:53.601
I'll never congratulate you, got it?

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.438
So we can't be friends?

00:30:59.607 --> 00:31:00.483
Friends?

00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:04.028
We're rivals.

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:06.614
Rivals?

00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:28.970
It just means black swamp.

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.764
I meant, "Sawako."

00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:36.019
Your name is Sawako Kuronuma, right?

00:31:36.686 --> 00:31:37.854
That moment,

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:40.565
my world was turned upside down.

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.484
Kuronuma.

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:45.987
The moment he said my name…

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:52.243
I fell in love.

00:31:54.621 --> 00:31:55.747
Are you done?

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:58.207
Oh, mm-mm, not yet.

00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:00.376
Then I'll help you.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.795
-No, it's okay.
-Let me have that.

00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:04.589
Thanks.
