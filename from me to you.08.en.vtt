WEBVTT

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:07.882
They're beautiful.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.634
-They are.
-Right?

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.388
-Wow.
-Oh, hey, would you look at that.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:16.349
It's beautiful!

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.102
Whoa.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.147
Hmm, cheesecake.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.525
Sawako?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.820
Mom! Dad!

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.365
Wait. Wait.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.785
He's obviously your boyfriend.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.037
Oh, hey!

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.292
Nice to meet you.
I'm her classmate, Shota Kazehaya.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.129
We are, uh…

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.589
We're dating.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.967
R… Right.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.887
He's my boyfriend, Shota Kazehaya.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.974
Thank you for taking care of her.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.606
I'm serious about this relationship.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.986
You already knew it.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.280
Well…

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:17.160
I meant to be against it if he was rude.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:18.995
I see.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.957
Kazehaya?

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.126
Yes, sir.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:30.215
Sawako looks so happy these days.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.804
I believe it's thanks to Chizu,
Ayane, and you, Kazehaya.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.014
Thank you.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:41.935
Dad.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.479
Please take good care of her.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.691
But don't cross the line.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.610
Understood?

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.321
Yes, sir.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:58.034
Kazehaya, you need to come over
for dinner sometime.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:01:59.369
Sure!

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.037
Enjoy.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.124
Let's go.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.925
-No way! Are you crying?
-Don't be silly!

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:26.646
What? Kazehaya met your parents?

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.690
He must've been nervous.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:32.110
Mmm, yes. They both seemed to like him.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:33.611
Ooh, that's good!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.488
It's going well then.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.617
But I don't feel like

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.078
it's real yet.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.956
I'm scared that it'll all end suddenly.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.210
What are you talking about?
You and Kazehaya will be just fine.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.796
-You think so?
-Mmm.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.383
Chizu, did you find someone else?

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:56.801
No.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.430
Toru was the only one so far.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:06.144
But I feel refreshed considering
how long I liked him.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.021
And I'm glad I told him that.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.148
Can I ask what you said to him?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.733
What?

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:16.112
I said, "I like you."

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.198
How about you, Sawako?

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.282
Huh?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.826
Well, I said,

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.370
"I like you."

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.374
I see. You two are quite simple.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.669
What? Then what do you say
to the person you like?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.713
I've never done that before.

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:34.964
Seriously?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.925
I don't because they confess to me.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:38.843
How snobby.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.013
I've never liked someone first.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.978
-During the school trip…
-Right?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.981
-Tokyo was so crowded.
-Look at this face.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:55.360
Where was that again?

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.696
It's Shibuya.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.324
-It was so fun.
-It was.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.242
Mmm.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.202
The donuts were expensive.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.621
The donuts were so good.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.916
-But expensive.
-Were they?

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.669
I love this picture.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.295
What?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.118
Oh, um…

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.412
Sorry. I… I just came to study.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.497
Go on.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.541
Good luck!

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.885
Sorry, it's time for you to go.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.263
Oh, you're right.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.671
Ahh!

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.969
I've lost all restraint.

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:47.305
I…

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.475
I meant to take it more slowly.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:01.527
FROM ME TO YOU: KIMI NI TODOKE

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:06.240
Sawako, you're having a lovey-dovey
Christmas with Kazehaya this year, right?

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.534
What? Are we supposed to?

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.038
You should.
I mean, he's your boyfriend.

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:14.457
Should I ask him?

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.958
You totally should.

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.002
Yoshida.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:22.215
What do you think of Sanada?

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:24.258
Huh?

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.843
Why all of a sudden?

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.011
What are you trying to say?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.306
I confessed my love to him.

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:34.310
And?

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.562
He turned me down.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.484
I asked him if he likes someone else,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.570
and he said, "Yes."

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:48.991
I wondered if it was you
since you're always by his side.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:52.829
So?

00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:55.998
So what if it is me?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.127
I just think

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:06.634
if you don't like him,
then you shouldn't always be by his side.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.429
Who cares?

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.473
It's none of your business!

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:23.234
RAMEN
TETSURYUKEN

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.369
A girl confessed her love to you?

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.914
And you turned her down?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.584
You didn't tell me a thing.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.045
It has nothing to do with you.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.468
Then don't let her come to me!
Settle it yourself.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.473
She kept mumbling,
saying you liked someone else.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.601
Want to know?

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.522
No!

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:04.942
I don't care!

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.503
Ayane, let's go home together.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.966
There are so many other girls.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.761
Pick someone more charming.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.056
Ah, don't say that. I think you're sweet.

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:36.682
Me?

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.100
No way.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.855
You were nice to me and Kurumi
when we were broken-hearted.

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.775
I bet you're actually a lot nicer.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.656
Hey, aren't you overestimating me?

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:56.410
On the contrary,
it's you who's underestimating yourself.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.955
I'm not.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.457
I'm just charmless.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.547
None of my ex-boyfriends
really loved me.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.925
I can't blame them for that.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.223
That's not true.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.479
Stop that.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.702
The day is getting shorter.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.413
Oh, mmm.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:48.838
It might be just me,

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:52.258
but I feel more distant from him.

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:59.390
Am I being too conscious and awkward?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.023
Kazehaya.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.234
About Christmas this year…

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.987
Mmm. Yeah, uh, let's get together.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.156
Mmm.

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.324
With everyone.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.494
Everyone?

00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:25.750
I was talking to Joe and the others.
I'll be the one coordinating.

00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.669
Mmm, I see.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.470
Let's go.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.514
Mmm.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.276
What?

00:10:56.238 --> 00:10:57.865
Isn't this awkward?

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:01.327
Did you forget how furious
I was the other day?

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:06.749
Well…

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:11.504
Are you listening?

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.592
It made me happy.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.221
You were interested in who I like.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.184
It made me happy.

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:41.575
You're the only one

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:43.703
I've ever loved.

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:49.834
Just…

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.253
you.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.932
First, we have the cubic root of 27.

00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:08.644
It's the number that equals 27
after being multiplied twice.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:09.979
So it has to be three.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.857
Next is the fourth root of 16.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:19.488
Kazehaya.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.659
It's unusual that Chizu is absent.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.661
I can't get hold of her either.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.830
Mmm. I wonder if she's home.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.498
Not sure.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.918
Shota, can we talk?

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.337
Sure.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.642
Aren't you hungry?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.146
Kazehaya? Why are you here?

00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:54.607
Ryu told me to bring this to you.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.443
Your mom passed it to him this morning.

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.114
Eat up.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.536
I will!
Why are you always so calm and collected?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.414
I hope everything is easy-peasy
between you and Sawako!

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.043
I have my share of troubles.

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:26.472
It's… so good!

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:30.684
Damn it!

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:33.062
I'm gonna be you when I'm reborn!

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.105
Huh? Why?

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:37.149
I mean, if I were you, then Ryu…

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.402
What?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.156
Nothing.

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.962
Did you know Ryu…

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.007
likes me?

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:03.968
Kind of.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.806
Mmm, well, people think he's kind of…

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.474
…hard to read.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.399
But it's obvious
that he cherishes you, regardless…

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.027
of whatever he's really thinking.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.495
It's the same for me.

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:33.998
I know it.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.628
I was just trying to act normally.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.757
But…

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:47.636
…things have completely changed.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.017
We aren't…

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.854
…brother and sister anymore.

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:05.487
Okay, guys,
stay out of trouble during the break.

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.617
If you're aiming for college, study hard.

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:13.162
You guys are having
a Christmas party tonight, aren't you?

00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:16.206
I'll be on a group blind date with nurses.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.086
Have a good time, everyone. That's all.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.212
Stand!

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.009
Bow!

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.136
Bye.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.311
Why aren't you spending
a lovey-dovey Christmas with Sadako?

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.189
That's okay.

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.442
Hmm, I see.

00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.319
What time?

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.488
Mmm, like 5:30?

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:50.491
-Yeah, sure.
-Chizuru, are you going to the party?

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.117
I'm going.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.037
Me too.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.790
It doesn't matter if you go or not.

00:15:57.873 --> 00:15:59.166
Then see you there.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.429
Don't look at me like that!

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:14.056
Oh, sorry.

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:17.184
Just think of yourself.

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:19.770
Oh, and I heard Kazehaya
is troubled with something these days.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:20.854
Troubled?

00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.440
A… About what?

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.235
I didn't ask about the details.

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.533
So that's why
he's acting different.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:35.995
-Is it okay to ask him?
-Let's do it.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.747
Is there
anything I can do for him?

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:49.800
Kazehaya!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:52.886
Can we talk?

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.014
Sure. What is it?

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.350
Let's go over there.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.483
Did something happen?

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:08.902
Well…

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:10.863
I mean…

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.032
I mean…

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:15.659
What is it?

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.621
I have a question.

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.427
Is something troubling you?

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:44.938
No.

00:17:48.358 --> 00:17:49.234
Okay.

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.030
I'm sorry.

00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:01.622
I need to get my bag, so…

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:03.665
Okay, bye.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.125
Bye.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.143
It's not my imagination.

00:18:23.977 --> 00:18:28.941
It's not me, but him
who's keeping distance.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:37.074
Am I the cause of his troubles?

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:45.499
Yano.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:47.251
Can we talk?

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.503
What is it?

00:18:58.178 --> 00:19:00.639
Do you know me? I'm Mogi from Class C.

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:05.519
We're joining you all
at the karaoke party today.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:07.938
Oh.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:09.982
And?

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.279
I've been interested in you for a while.

00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:20.701
It's so out of the blue.
I don't understand.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.537
I never had a chance to talk with you,

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.748
so I didn't have the courage
to bring this up.

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:31.962
But can we talk a bit alone
at the class party?

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.091
Sorry, but I'm not really interested.

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.469
Uh, I won't give up.

00:19:39.553 --> 00:19:41.013
Can we talk again?

00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:52.733
That was Mogi from Class C, right?

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:54.568
What happened?

00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:00.032
He confessed he likes me,
but I turned him down.

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.707
Let's start the Christmas party! Cheers!

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.417
Cheers!

00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:12.669
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.423
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:17.883
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:22.763
The three of us have arrived!

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.723
Ooh, so many of you are already here!

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:26.934
Can we sit here? Can we sit here?

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.978
Hey, you guys are late!

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.730
Oh!

00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:32.773
Sit here.

00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:36.735
Okay, turn in your presents.
We'll start the gift exchange.

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:38.904
-Okay!
-Okay, put it in here.

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.033
You guys too. Put them in.

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:46.954
-Here.
-Sorry, but I'm out.

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:47.955
Huh?

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:49.414
Isn't that for this?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.084
-What is it?
-Don't touch this!

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:54.670
It's not…

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.380
It's not for this.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.932
What's up with her?

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.727
It's okay. I'll go.

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.870
It's so cold!

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.669
Are you okay?

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.970
I got this for you.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.018
Thank you.

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:10.287
Looks good?

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.082
Mmm.

00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:21.465
This is for you.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:36.897
Isn't it like you?

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.148
Huh?

00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:39.441
H… How?

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:43.403
I don't know how to explain it.

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.034
This is what

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.037
I look like to you?

00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.878
What's this?

00:22:59.961 --> 00:23:00.921
Thank you!

00:23:01.004 --> 00:23:02.381
Let's go back!

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:03.340
No.

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.928
It's been a while.

00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:09.930
Let's talk more.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.106
-The party's heating up.
-Mmm.

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:32.536
Hey, Kuronuma.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.788
Aren't you going in?

00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.999
Mr. Arai.
You're here for karaoke too?

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.835
I'm crashing your party.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.753
Who cares about the nurses!

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:44.798
Huh?

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.969
Is this you thinking about nonsense again?

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.514
It must be about Shota.

00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:57.436
I…

00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.439
I'm hopeless.

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:04.401
I only think about myself.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:08.363
I found someone so precious to me.

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:11.741
I want to know everything about him.

00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:15.912
I want to keep all of him
to myself.

00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:20.584
But it's not possible.

00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.127
Mmm.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.716
Well, if he made you think like that,
I guess he isn't completely useless.

00:24:28.216 --> 00:24:29.217
Useless?

00:24:30.093 --> 00:24:33.972
Don't suppress your feelings,
or you'll end up regretting it.

00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:38.894
Come on.
You have desires and ambitions, don't you?

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.564
Although Shota is stubborn…

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:43.648
Hmm.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.818
…wouldn't he understand
if you told him what you really want?

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:50.739
Your true thoughts
really aren't that much of a big deal,

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.824
so just spit them out.

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:05.754
If I told him my true thoughts,
would he accept them?

00:25:08.298 --> 00:25:09.382
I'm scared.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:13.720
I'm scared, but I want to know

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:17.682
what he's really thinking too.

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:26.149
Seriously?
Wait, so she's not really that easy?

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:28.276
-She may not sleep with me.
-Oh, man.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.278
-Does it mean that I won the bet?
-No.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.363
It's not over yet.

00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:33.448
-Huh?
-I'll try again today.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.033
Oh.

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:40.455
Uh, hi… hi, Yano.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.373
Oh.

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:42.374
Um…

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:43.875
Uh…

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:46.211
That's what it was about?

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:53.510
I heard a rumor
you like that kind of stuff…

00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.345
…so I… I wanted to see.

00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:58.598
What the heck?

00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:00.642
You're betting on Ayane?

00:26:01.768 --> 00:26:02.727
Oh, well…

00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:04.521
Oh!

00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:07.107
-Don't mess around with her!
-What's your problem?

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.943
Don't you ever use her
for your stupid bets again!

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:13.738
Don't!

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.286
Ayane?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.624
Doing that is pointless.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.438
Are you okay?

00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:51.359
It's nothing.

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:55.947
But thank you.

00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:00.910
Of course, right?

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.290
I can only attract jerks like him.

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:17.594
If you've never loved anyone,

00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.180
then you can start with me.

00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:21.931
I mean…

00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:25.310
it doesn't have to be now, of course.

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.565
I'll always cherish you, Ayane.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.216
-All right, the party's over!
-Huh?

00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.635
No after-parties for brats, got it?

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:09.521
Shall we go?

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:11.648
Mmm.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:33.211
I worry about
if everything suddenly ended.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:37.424
But maybe it already has.

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:41.928
I was so desperate
to be with him last year,

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:45.515
and it finally happened, but…

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:56.317
If you ever do that again,
don't be surprised at what happens!

00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:19.549
What's the matter, Kuronuma?

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.020
Liar.

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:38.526
You're a liar!

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:41.863
You lied about not having any troubles!

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:49.913
Today…

00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.498
…I just…

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:54.417
wanted to be with you.

00:29:56.002 --> 00:29:56.836
I know…

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.927
you were doing all this
for the sake of others.

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:05.887
I know that.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.435
But I felt lonelier than if I were alone.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.734
Are you troubled because of me?

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:25.865
Do you regret about us?

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:31.120
You…

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.041
don't like me anymore?

00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:43.550
You don't like me being like this?

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.039
I like you.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.334
I love you.

00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:47.697
Finally, you're looking at me.
